    "text": "You’ve scavenged two donors. But things happen: a PSU dies, a leadscrew is bent, bearings are worn, or you discover a mainboard is unusable. This guide helps you source replacement parts from the secondhand market (AliExpress, Temu, eBay) without getting scammed or buying duds.\nBudget reality: Expect to spend $80-150 on parts you can’t scavenge, depending on donor condition and your frame path. Plan for contingencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart\nWhy Needed\nTypical Cost\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nM10 Threaded Rods\nScaffold frame skeleton\n$30-45\n8 rods per set; check length\n\n\nM8 Lead Screws\nZ-axis motion (Triple-Z)\n$15-25\nT8 2mm pitch standard; verify in photos\n\n\n8mm Smooth Rods\nX-Y motion (if donors lack)\n$40-60\n8× rods, check straightness\n\n\nIGUS RJ4JP-01-08\nBearings (if donors worn)\n$25-35\nCheap alternative to LM8UU; check brand\n\n\nPower Supply\nIf donor PSU dead\n$40-80\n24V preferred; verify wattage\n\n\nNEMA17 Motors\nIf donor motors bad\n$10-15 each\nUsually abundant, but verify shaft\n\n\nMisc Bolts/Springs\nAssembly\n$15-20\nM3, M4, M5 assortment; cheap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you buy anything, know exactly what you need:\n\n\n\nM10 threaded rods: 1.5mm pitch, fully threaded (not partially)\nM8 lead screws: T8 2mm pitch (not 8mm pitch—yes, this confusion exists!)\n8mm smooth rods: 8.00 ±0.02mm diameter (not 8.5mm or “precision” variants)\nLM8UU bearing: 8mm bore, 15mm OD, 45mm length (not LM8, not generic “linear bearing”)\nIGUS RJ4JP-01-08: Polymer, 8mm bore (cheaper than LM8UU, acceptable for Amalgam)\nPSU: Check voltage (12V vs. 24V) AND wattage (30A minimum for 24V systems = 720W)\nNEMA17: 1.8° step angle (not 0.9°), standard mounting face\n\n\n\n\n🚩 Avoid these: - Suspiciously cheap (99¢ for 8× rods? probably fake/short lengths) - Zero reviews or only 1-2 reviews - Fuzzy/low-quality photos or generic stock images (not showing the actual product) - Vague descriptions (“linear bearing set” with no size spec) - Photos don’t match description (“shows 12mm rod but title says 8mm”) - Seller has low ratings on other items (pattern of problems) - Shipping “from China” with “fast delivery” but actually 6-8 weeks\n\n\n\n✅ Look for these: - 10+ reviews with photos (shows real user experience) - Reviews mention “fits perfectly,” “exactly as described,” “good quality” - Photos show the actual product clearly (not stock images; you can see details) - Seller specializes in 3D printer parts (high rating across multiple items) - Clear specs in title + description (e.g., “8×250mm Smooth Rod, 8.00mm diameter”) - Honest shipping timeline (2-4 weeks from China, clearly stated) - Seller responds to questions with clarification photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPitfall\nWhat Happens\nHow to Spot\nFix\n\n\n\n\nMixed pack sizes\nOrder says “8 rods” but it’s 2 long + 2 short + 4 medium\nCheck ALL photos carefully; count pieces\nMessage seller for specification\n\n\nCounterfeit bearings\nFake IGUS or LM8UU logo; poor quality\nCompare packaging to verified images; check seller history\nOrder from established 3D printer supplier\n\n\nWrong lead screw pitch\nT8 comes in 2mm AND 8mm pitch; ordered wrong\nPhotos must show the pitch clearly; read reviews mentioning it\nVerify with seller before ordering\n\n\nWrong voltage PSU\nPSU says 12V but is actually 24V (or vice versa)\nCheck product photos for actual labels (not just title)\nMessage seller; ask for label photo\n\n\nShipping takes forever\n“3-5 day shipping” actually takes 4-6 weeks\nRead negative reviews about shipping time\nAccept 2-4 weeks as realistic from China\n\n\nBroken on arrival\nRod bent, bearing seized, PSU dead from shipping shock\nBuy from sellers with good return policy; request protective packaging\nCheck AliExpress “buyer protection” or eBay returns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you hit “buy”:\n\nCheck seller profile\n\nHow many items sold?

    "text": "✅ Still Relevant: This deep exploration of extruder options and rationale for Pitan selection remains current. For canonical decision, see: - ADR-019: Pitan Extruder (formal decision, supersedes ADR-002: Greg’s Wade)\nThis deep-dive provides detailed engineering analysis of why Pitan was chosen (cost, scavengability, performance, Klipper compatibility).\n\n\n\nAfter extensive evaluation of weight, cost, scavengability, mechanical performance, drive architecture, and Klipper compatibility, the Pitan Extruder has been selected as the Amalgam reference specification.\nKey Decision: Single-Drive Architecture\nAmalgam uses single-drive extruders exclusively. Dual-drive designs (BMG, Sherpa, Orbiter, LGX) introduce gear mesh artifacts that affect print quality consistency — a hidden factor in why Bambu Lab printers achieve exceptional results with their single-drive design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nExtruder\nDrive\nMotor\nCost\nWeight\nStatus\n\n\n\n\n1\nGreg’s Wade\n✅ Single\nNEMA17\n~$2-5\n360-600g\n⚠️ Heritage (PLA/PETG)\n\n\n2\nMK8/MK9\n✅ Single\nNEMA17\n~$0-6\n150-200g\n⚠️ Ultra-Scavenger\n\n\n3\nSherpa Mini\n❌ Dual\nNEMA14\n~$22-34\n110-127g\n❌ Dual-drive\n\n\n4\nSherpa Micro\n❌ Dual\nNEMA14\n~$20-34\n~85g\n❌ Dual-drive\n\n\n5\nOrbiter v1.5\n❌ Dual\nLDO specific\n~$60-100\n140-150g\n❌ Dual-drive, cost\n\n\n6\nBondtech LGX Lite\n❌ Dual\nNEMA14\n~$120-150\n150-165g\n❌ Dual-drive, cost\n\n\n7\nPitan\n✅ Single\nNEMA17\n~$4-10\n260-300g\n✅ Reference Spec\n\n\n8\nVoron (various)\n❌ Dual\nVarious\n~$60-120\n100-150g\n❌ Cost, complexity\n\n\n9\nBMG Clone\n❌ Dual\nNEMA17\n~$15-25\n250-350g\n❌ Dual-drive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTier\nExtruder\nCost\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n✅ Reference Spec\nPitan + NEMA17\n~$4-10\nBest balance for Tractor philosophy\n\n\n⚠️ Heritage Option\nWade + Pancake NEMA17\n~$2-5\nRepRap nostalgia, PLA/PETG only\n\n\n⚠️ Ultra-Scavenger\nMK8 Direct\n~$0-6\nIf you have one, PLA/PETG only\n\n\n\nImportant: This is the reference specification. As a tinkerer/maker, you’re free to use whatever extruder configuration suits you—perhaps you have one in your parts bin. Use that!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Amalgam project follows the “Tractor with the Brain of a Racecar” philosophy:\n\nQuality over Speed — Not chasing 300mm/s; targeting reliable 80-120mm/s\nScavenger-Friendly — Parts from donor printers, hardware stores, and minimal purchases\nKlipper Intelligence — Software compensates for mechanical simplicity\nBudget-Conscious — Target $300 AUD total build cost\nRepairability — Print your own replacement parts\n\nThe extruder choice must serve these principles, not fight them.\n\n\n\nModern printers like the Bambu Lab X1C prove that a well-tuned single direct-drive extruder achieves superior print quality through software intelligence rather than raw mechanical complexity.\n\nKey Finding: A 150g extruder with Klipper Input Shaping produces better quality than a 600g extruder without it, at any speed under 150mm/s.\n\nThis insight shaped our entire evaluation process.\n\n\n\nEarly in our evaluation, we made a key architectural decision: Amalgam will use a single-drive extruder.\nWhat’s the difference?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nMechanism\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nSingle-drive\nOne drive gear + one idler bearing\nPitan, Wade, MK8, E3D Titan\n\n\nDual-drive\nTwo meshing drive gears, both grip filament\nBMG, Sherpa Mini, Orbiter, LGX Lite\n\n\n\nWhy single-drive for Amalgam?\nDual-drive extruders have a hidden quality issue: gear meshing artifacts. When two drive gears mesh, microscopic variations in tooth engagement create periodic pressure fluctuations on the filament. This manifests as subtle but measurable extrusion inconsistencies.\n\nThe Bambu Lab Secret: One reason Bambu Lab printers achieve exceptional print quality is their use of single-drive extruders. While the community often focuses on their motion system and software, the single-drive design eliminates gear mesh artifacts entirely.\n\nEngineering trade-offs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor\nSingle-Drive\nDual-Drive\n\n\n\n\nExtrusion consistency\n✅ No mesh artifacts\n⚠️ Periodic micro-variations\n\n\nFilament grip (rigid)\n✅ Adequate with good tension\n✅ Excellent\n\n\nFilament grip (TPU)\n⚠️ Requires careful tuning\n✅ Superior\n\n\nMechanical complexity\n✅ Simpler\n⚠️ More parts\n\n\nFailure modes\n✅ Fewer\n⚠️ Gear wear, alignment\n\n\n\nFor Amalgam’s quality-focused philosophy at 80-120mm/s, the single-drive advantages outweigh the dual-drive TPU benefits. We’re building a Tractor for consistent quality, not a race car for exotic filaments.\nThis decision shaped our entire evaluation. Several excellent extruders (Sherpa Mini, Orbiter, LGX Lite) were evaluated but ultimately not selected as reference spec due to their dual-drive architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greg’s Wade is the “Flat-6 Engine” of 3D printing—mechanical, geared, visible torque. Pure RepRap heritage from 2007-2009.\nSpecifications: | Attribute | Value | |———–|——-| | Gear Ratio | 5.22:1 (39:11 or similar, varies by version) | | Motor | Full NEMA17 (or pancake variant) | | Weight | 450-600g (full motor) / 360-410g (pancake) | | Drive | Single hobbed bolt + idler | | Original Design | 3.00mm filament (adaptable to 1.75mm) |\nPros: - ✅ Single-drive design (no gear mesh artifacts) - Massive torque — 5.22:1 ratio with NEMA17 = overkill for any filament - Zero proprietary parts (M8 bolts, 608 bearings, printed gears) - Full repairability (print replacement gears for $0.50) - Heat creep resistance (motor far from hotend) - True RepRap heritage and philosophy\nCons: - Heavy with full NEMA17 — 450-600g causes significant gantry sag - Originally designed for 3.00mm filament (longer filament path) - 1.75mm adaptation has exposed filament path — TPU will buckle - Forces upgrade to M10 rods with full motor (can’t use scavenged M8) - Inertia causes ringing at direction changes\nPancake Motor Variant:\nWith a pancake NEMA17 (~160g vs ~350g), the Wade drops to ~360-410g total. The 5.22:1 gear ratio provides enough mechanical advantage that the reduced motor torque (~17 N·cm motor × 5.22 = ~89 N·cm output) remains adequate for PLA/PETG.\nEngineering Analysis:\nRod sag calculations: - M8 rods + Wade (full motor, 600g), 250mm span: ~0.037mm sag (borderline) - M8 rods + Wade (full motor, 600g), 280mm span: ~0.052mm sag (❌ too much) - M8 rods + Wade (pancake, 385g), 250mm span: ~0.024mm sag (✅ good) - M8 rods + Wade (pancake, 385g), 280mm span: ~0.034mm sag (✅ acceptable) - M10 rods + Wade (full motor), 280mm span: ~0.021mm sag (✅ good)\nVerdict: The Wade with a pancake NEMA17 becomes M8-compatible and offers pure RepRap heritage. However, the 3.00mm filament path design makes it unsuitable for TPU with 1.75mm filament. Documented as heritage option for PLA/PETG builders who value RepRap roots.\nStatus: ⚠️ Heritage Option (PLA/PETG only, pancake motor recommended)\n\n\n\n\nThe MK8 is the simplest possible extruder — a drive gear mounted directly on the motor shaft with an idler bearing opposite. No gearing, no reduction, pure simplicity.\nSpecifications: | Attribute | Value | |———–|——-| | Gear Ratio | 1:1 (direct drive, no reduction) | | Motor | NEMA17 standard | | Weight | ~150-200g complete | | Drive | Single MK8 gear + idler |\nPros: - ✅ Single-drive design (no gear mesh artifacts) - Ultra-simple — fewest parts of any extruder - Extremely scavengeable (every cheap printer has one) - Lightweight enables M8 rods easily - Near-zero cost if scavenged\nCons: - No gear reduction means relying entirely on motor torque - Less forgiving of partial clogs or high-viscosity filaments - Higher motor current required for equivalent pushing force - TPU difficult without the mechanical advantage of gearing\nCost Breakdown: | Component | Cost (AUD) | |———–|————| | MK8 drive gear | $1-3 (or scavenged) | | NEMA17 motor | $0 (scavenged) | | Idler bearing + arm | $0-2 (scavenged/printed) | | Hardware | $1 | | Total | $0-6 |\nEngineering Analysis:\nWithout gear reduction, motor torque = output torque. A typical NEMA17 provides ~40-45 N·cm, which is adequate for PLA/PETG at moderate speeds but offers no headroom for difficult situations.\nKlipper’s pressure advance helps compensate for the lack of mechanical advantage, making MK8 more viable than it would be on Marlin.\nVerdict: Viable ultra-budget option for PLA/PETG if you already have one. The lack of gear reduction limits performance ceiling. Not recommended as primary choice but documented for completeness.\nStatus: ⚠️ Ultra-Scavenger Option (PLA/PETG only)\n\n\n\n\nThe following extruders were carefully evaluated but not selected as reference spec due to their dual-drive architecture, which introduces gear mesh artifacts that affect print quality consistency.\n\n\n\nDeveloped by Annex Engineering, the Sherpa Mini is the de facto standard for lightweight direct-drive in the Voron community. Uses BMG clone gears in a compact dual-drive configuration.\nSpecifications: | Attribute | Value | |———–|——-| | Gear Ratio | 5:1 (50:10) or 6.25:1 (50:8) | | Motor | Round NEMA14 pancake with pinion | | Weight | 110-127g complete | | Drive | ❌ BMG clone dual-drive |\nPros: - Extremely light (~120g) — no gantry sag - BMG gears ubiquitous ($3-8, available everywhere) - Massive community (PDF manual, Discord, years of refinement) - Dual-drive excellent for TPU - Battle-tested (thousands in service) - Printable body\nCons: - ❌ Dual-drive architecture — gear mesh artifacts affect consistency - Requires specific NEMA14 pancake motor with integrated pinion (~$14-21 AUD) - Heat-set inserts require soldering iron - BMG quality varies by vendor - Motor not scavengeable from donor printers\nCost Breakdown: | Component | Cost (AUD) | |———–|————| | BMG clone gear set | $3-8 | | Round NEMA14 pancake motor | $14-21 | | Hardware, inserts, PTFE | ~$5 | | Total | $22-34 |\nEngineering Analysis:\nRod sag calculations (250mm span): - M8 rods + Sherpa (NEMA14): ~0.015mm sag (excellent)\nThe Sherpa Mini is mechanically excellent. Its rejection for Amalgam is purely architectural — the dual-drive design conflicts with our quality philosophy.\nVerdict: Excellent extruder for builders who prioritize TPU capability and lightweight toolheads over absolute extrusion consistency. Not selected due to dual-drive architecture and non-scavengeable motor.\nStatus: ❌ Not Recommended (dual-drive architecture)\n\n\n\n\nThe Sherpa Micro is an even more compact version of the Sherpa Mini, designed for the smallest possible toolhead footprint.\nSpecifications: | Attribute | Value | |———–|——-| | Gear Ratio | ~4:1 | | Motor | Round NEMA14 pancake with 6T pinion | | Weight | ~85g complete | | Drive | ❌ Dual-drive (BMG-style) |\nPros: - Extremely compact and lightweight (~85g) - Excellent for space-constrained builds - Printable body - Good community support (shares ecosystem with Sherpa Mini)\nCons: - ❌ Dual-drive architecture — gear mesh artifacts - Requires specific NEMA14 motor with integrated pinion (~$14-21 AUD) - Motor not scavengeable - Less torque than Sherpa Mini due to smaller gearing\nCost Breakdown: | Component | Cost (AUD) | |———–|————| | BMG clone gear set | $3-8 | | Round NEMA14 pancake motor (6T) | $14-21 | | Hardware, inserts | ~$3-5 | | Total | $20-34 |\nVerdict: Even more compact than Sherpa Mini but shares the same dual-drive limitation. The smaller gearing also reduces torque headroom.\nStatus: ❌ Not Recommended (dual-drive architecture)\n\n\n\n\nThe Orbiter is a high-performance planetary geared extruder designed by Róbert Lőrincz in cooperation with LDO Motors. Features an innovative orbiting gear mechanism.\nSpecifications: | Attribute | Value | |———–|——-| | Gear Ratio | 7.5:1 (planetary) | | Motor | LDO-36STH20-1004AHG (specific motor required) | | Weight | ~140-150g complete | | Drive | ❌ Dual-drive planetary | | Filament Force | Up to 9.4kg pushing force |\nPros: - Very high gear ratio (7.5:1) in compact package - Excellent filament pushing force - High-quality injection molded housing (glass-fiber reinforced nylon) - Good for high-speed printing and flexible filaments - Proven design with strong community\nCons: - ❌ Dual-drive architecture — planetary gears still mesh - Requires specific LDO motor (~$50-75 AUD) — not scavengeable - Expensive complete kit (~$75-100 AUD) - Proprietary gears — clone quality questionable (~$10 AUD but risky) - Injection molded parts — not printable for repairs\nCost Breakdown: | Component | Cost (AUD) | |———–|————| | Orbiter v1.5 kit with motor | $75-100 | | OR: Clone gears + LDO motor | $10 + $50-75 | | Total | $60-100 |\nEngineering Analysis:\nThe Orbiter’s 7.5:1 ratio provides exceptional torque from a small motor, enabling high acceleration extrusion. However, the planetary gear system is still dual-drive — two gears grip the filament, introducing mesh artifacts.\nVerdict: Excellent high-performance extruder, but the specific motor requirement, cost, and dual-drive architecture exclude it from Amalgam consideration. The clone gears available on AliExpress (~$10) are a quality gamble.\nStatus: ❌ Not Recommended (dual-drive, specific motor, cost)\n\n\n\n\nThe Bondtech LGX Lite is a commercial extruder using Bondtech’s “Large Gears eXtruder” technology with oversized drive gears for increased filament contact.\nSpecifications: | Attribute | Value | |———–|——-| | Gear Ratio | ~3.5:1 (44:10, 37:17 compound) | | Motor | Round NEMA14 36mm pancake | | Weight | ~150-165g complete | | Drive | ❌ Dual-drive (Bondtech LGX gears) | | Filament Tension | 3-position lever (open/rigid/flexible) |\nPros: - High-quality commercial product - Large drive gears (18mm Ø) = 50% more filament contact area - Excellent tension adjustment system - Good for flexible filaments - Professional injection-molded PA12 housing\nCons: - ❌ Dual-drive architecture — two meshing gears - Expensive — ~$120-150 AUD complete with motor - Commercial product — no printed parts, no customization - Requires specific NEMA14 motor (~$25-35 AUD) - Not scavengeable, not repairable with printed parts\nCost Breakdown: | Component | Cost (AUD) | |———–|————| | LGX Lite V2 with motor | $120-150 | | LGX Lite V2 without motor | $85-100 | | NEMA14 36mm motor | $25-35 | | Total | $120-150 |\nVerdict: Premium commercial option with excellent build quality, but the cost exceeds our entire extruder budget, and the dual-drive architecture conflicts with our quality philosophy. Represents the opposite of RepRap principles — buy rather than build.\nStatus: ❌ Not Recommended (dual-drive, cost, commercial)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pitan (Printable Titan) is a 3D-printed clone of the E3D Titan, designed for the RepRap philosophy—lightweight, easy to assemble, and optimized for NEMA17 motors with full repairability.\nSpecifications: | Attribute | Value | |———–|——-| | Gear Ratio | 3:1 (same as E3D Titan) | | Motor | NEMA17 standard or pancake | | Weight | ~260-300g (with NEMA17) | | Drive | ✅ Single drive gear + idler (Titan-style) |\nPros: - ✅ Single-drive design — no gear mesh artifacts - Motor scavengeable — Uses standard NEMA17 from any donor printer - Fully printable gears and body (true RepRap spirit) - 3:1 gear ratio provides excellent torque - Moderate weight enables M8 rods at 250mm span - Can use pancake NEMA17 for lighter builds - Simple design is easy to maintain and repair\nCons: - Heavier than Sherpa Mini (but lighter than Wade) - Single-drive less aggressive than dual-drive for flexible filaments (TPU) - Less community support than Sherpa\nCost Breakdown: | Component | Cost (AUD) | |———–|————| | Pitan printed parts (body + gears) | $0.50-1 (filament) | | NEMA17 motor | $0 (scavenged) | | 608 bearings | $0-2 | | Hobbed bolt or MK8 drive gear | $2-5 | | Hardware (springs, fasteners) | $1-2 | | Total | $3.50-10 |\nEngineering Analysis:\nRod sag calculations: - M8 @ 250mm span + Pitan/NEMA17: ~0.024mm sag (very good) - M8 @ 280mm span + Pitan/NEMA17: ~0.034mm sag (acceptable) - M10 @ 280mm span + Pitan/NEMA17: ~0.014mm sag (excellent)\nWhy Pitan Wins for Amalgam:\n\nScavengeable motor — The NEMA17 from your Ender 3 donor works perfectly\nEnables M8 rods — Don’t need to upgrade to M10 for reasonable spans\n3:1 geared torque — Handles PLA, PETG reliably; adequate for careful TPU\nPrintable — “If a gear breaks, you have a new one before your coffee gets cold”\nBudget — $4-10 vs $18-28 for Sherpa saves money for other components\n\nStatus: ✅ Selected as Reference Specification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese represent the “Formula 1” extruders—designed for Voron CoreXY machines chasing 300-500mm/s.\nSpecifications: | Attribute | Value | |———–|——-| | Weight | 100-150g | | Cost | $60-120 (Bondtech kit required) | | Complexity | Very high |\nWhy Not Recommended:\n\n\n\nIssue\nImpact on Amalgam\n\n\n\n\nCost\n$60-120 exceeds entire extruder budget\n\n\nProprietary\nRequires Bondtech/BMG kits that can’t be scavenged\n\n\nComplexity\nMany tiny parts, precision assembly\n\n\nOverkill\nDesigned for 300mm/s; we target 80-120mm/s\n\n\nPhilosophy Mismatch\nRacing speed vs. reliable quality\n\n\n\nThe Defense:\n\n“We chose the Pitan not because Voron extruders are bad, but because they solve problems we don’t have.

Second, it requires a specific NEMA14 pancake motor that can’t be scavenged. The Pitan delivers cleaner extrusion with motors from any donor printer.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Fair skepticism! The effect is subtle but measurable — periodic micro-variations in extrusion pressure as gear teeth mesh and unmesh. For most printing it’s invisible. But Amalgam targets quality over speed, and the single-drive architecture removes one variable from the quality equation. It’s also why Bambu Lab — known for print quality — uses single-drive designs.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Orbiter is excellent for high-speed printing where you need rapid extrusion acceleration. But Amalgam targets 80-120mm/s where the Pitan’s 3:1 ratio is plenty. The Orbiter also requires a specific $50-75 LDO motor and costs $75-100 complete. For our philosophy, the Pitan’s $4-10 with scavenged motor makes more sense.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Wade’s 5.22:1 ratio provides impressive torque, but it was designed for 3.00mm filament. The adapted 1.75mm filament path has too much exposure — TPU will buckle and jam. With a pancake motor it’s M8-compatible and makes a fine heritage option for PLA/PETG, but the Pitan handles all materials better.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Voron extruders are designed for 300mm/s+ racing with dual-drive BMG gears. Amalgam targets 80-120mm/s quality printing with single-drive consistency. The $60-120 cost of a Clockwork 2 kit equals our entire extruder budget plus half the frame. We’d rather spend that money on a better heated bed or quality thermistors.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Absolutely! The Pitan is our reference spec, but you’re a maker — use what you have. If there’s a Sherpa, Orbiter, or BMG in your parts bin, use it. The dual-drive concerns are about optimal quality for new builds, not a condemnation of existing equipment. The documentation is a starting point, not a constraint.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pitan extruder embodies the Amalgam philosophy:\n\n\n\nPrinciple\nHow Pitan Delivers\n\n\n\n\nQuality-Focused\n✅ Single-drive = no gear mesh artifacts\n\n\nScavenger-Friendly\nUses NEMA17 from any donor printer\n\n\nBudget-Conscious\n$4-10 total cost\n\n\nRepairable\nPrint replacement parts yourself\n\n\nMechanically Sound\n3:1 gearing + Klipper = consistent extrusion\n\n\nM8 Compatible\nEnables scavenged rods at practical spans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“A tractor doesn’t win races.

    "text": "The Amalgam project follows the “Tractor with the Brain of a Racecar” philosophy:\n\nQuality over Speed — Not chasing 300mm/s; targeting reliable 80-120mm/s\nScavenger-Friendly — Parts from donor printers, hardware stores, and minimal purchases\nKlipper Intelligence — Software compensates for mechanical simplicity\nBudget-Conscious — Target $300 AUD total build cost\nRepairability — Print your own replacement parts\n\nThe extruder choice must serve these principles, not fight them.\n\n\n\nModern printers like the Bambu Lab X1C prove that a well-tuned single direct-drive extruder achieves superior print quality through software intelligence rather than raw mechanical complexity.\n\nKey Finding: A 150g extruder with Klipper Input Shaping produces better quality than a 600g extruder without it, at any speed under 150mm/s.\n\nThis insight shaped our entire evaluation process.\n\n\n\nEarly in our evaluation, we made a key architectural decision: Amalgam will use a single-drive extruder.\nWhat’s the difference?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nMechanism\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nSingle-drive\nOne drive gear + one idler bearing\nPitan, Wade, MK8, E3D Titan\n\n\nDual-drive\nTwo meshing drive gears, both grip filament\nBMG, Sherpa Mini, Orbiter, LGX Lite\n\n\n\nWhy single-drive for Amalgam?\nDual-drive extruders have a hidden quality issue: gear meshing artifacts. When two drive gears mesh, microscopic variations in tooth engagement create periodic pressure fluctuations on the filament. This manifests as subtle but measurable extrusion inconsistencies.\n\nThe Bambu Lab Secret: One reason Bambu Lab printers achieve exceptional print quality is their use of single-drive extruders. While the community often focuses on their motion system and software, the single-drive design eliminates gear mesh artifacts entirely.\n\nEngineering trade-offs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor\nSingle-Drive\nDual-Drive\n\n\n\n\nExtrusion consistency\n✅ No mesh artifacts\n⚠️ Periodic micro-variations\n\n\nFilament grip (rigid)\n✅ Adequate with good tension\n✅ Excellent\n\n\nFilament grip (TPU)\n⚠️ Requires careful tuning\n✅ Superior\n\n\nMechanical complexity\n✅ Simpler\n⚠️ More parts\n\n\nFailure modes\n✅ Fewer\n⚠️ Gear wear, alignment\n\n\n\nFor Amalgam’s quality-focused philosophy at 80-120mm/s, the single-drive advantages outweigh the dual-drive TPU benefits. We’re building a Tractor for consistent quality, not a race car for exotic filaments.\nThis decision shaped our entire evaluation. Several excellent extruders (Sherpa Mini, Orbiter, LGX Lite) were evaluated but ultimately not selected as reference spec due to their dual-drive architecture.",

    "text": "The Greg’s Wade is the “Flat-6 Engine” of 3D printing—mechanical, geared, visible torque. Pure RepRap heritage from 2007-2009.\nSpecifications: | Attribute | Value | |———–|——-| | Gear Ratio | 5.22:1 (39:11 or similar, varies by version) | | Motor | Full NEMA17 (or pancake variant) | | Weight | 450-600g (full motor) / 360-410g (pancake) | | Drive | Single hobbed bolt + idler | | Original Design | 3.00mm filament (adaptable to 1.75mm) |\nPros: - ✅ Single-drive design (no gear mesh artifacts) - Massive torque — 5.22:1 ratio with NEMA17 = overkill for any filament - Zero proprietary parts (M8 bolts, 608 bearings, printed gears) - Full repairability (print replacement gears for $0.50) - Heat creep resistance (motor far from hotend) - True RepRap heritage and philosophy\nCons: - Heavy with full NEMA17 — 450-600g causes significant gantry sag - Originally designed for 3.00mm filament (longer filament path) - 1.75mm adaptation has exposed filament path — TPU will buckle - Forces upgrade to M10 rods with full motor (can’t use scavenged M8) - Inertia causes ringing at direction changes\nPancake Motor Variant:\nWith a pancake NEMA17 (~160g vs ~350g), the Wade drops to ~360-410g total. The 5.22:1 gear ratio provides enough mechanical advantage that the reduced motor torque (~17 N·cm motor × 5.22 = ~89 N·cm output) remains adequate for PLA/PETG.\nEngineering Analysis:\nRod sag calculations: - M8 rods + Wade (full motor, 600g), 250mm span: ~0.037mm sag (borderline) - M8 rods + Wade (full motor, 600g), 280mm span: ~0.052mm sag (❌ too much) - M8 rods + Wade (pancake, 385g), 250mm span: ~0.024mm sag (✅ good) - M8 rods + Wade (pancake, 385g), 280mm span: ~0.034mm sag (✅ acceptable) - M10 rods + Wade (full motor), 280mm span: ~0.021mm sag (✅ good)\nVerdict: The Wade with a pancake NEMA17 becomes M8-compatible and offers pure RepRap heritage. However, the 3.00mm filament path design makes it unsuitable for TPU with 1.75mm filament. Documented as heritage option for PLA/PETG builders who value RepRap roots.\nStatus: ⚠️ Heritage Option (PLA/PETG only, pancake motor recommended)\n\n\n\n\nThe MK8 is the simplest possible extruder — a drive gear mounted directly on the motor shaft with an idler bearing opposite. No gearing, no reduction, pure simplicity.\nSpecifications: | Attribute | Value | |———–|——-| | Gear Ratio | 1:1 (direct drive, no reduction) | | Motor | NEMA17 standard | | Weight | ~150-200g complete | | Drive | Single MK8 gear + idler |\nPros: - ✅ Single-drive design (no gear mesh artifacts) - Ultra-simple — fewest parts of any extruder - Extremely scavengeable (every cheap printer has one) - Lightweight enables M8 rods easily - Near-zero cost if scavenged\nCons: - No gear reduction means relying entirely on motor torque - Less forgiving of partial clogs or high-viscosity filaments - Higher motor current required for equivalent pushing force - TPU difficult without the mechanical advantage of gearing\nCost Breakdown: | Component | Cost (AUD) | |———–|————| | MK8 drive gear | $1-3 (or scavenged) | | NEMA17 motor | $0 (scavenged) | | Idler bearing + arm | $0-2 (scavenged/printed) | | Hardware | $1 | | Total | $0-6 |\nEngineering Analysis:\nWithout gear reduction, motor torque = output torque. A typical NEMA17 provides ~40-45 N·cm, which is adequate for PLA/PETG at moderate speeds but offers no headroom for difficult situations.\nKlipper’s pressure advance helps compensate for the lack of mechanical advantage, making MK8 more viable than it would be on Marlin.\nVerdict: Viable ultra-budget option for PLA/PETG if you already have one. The lack of gear reduction limits performance ceiling. Not recommended as primary choice but documented for completeness.\nStatus: ⚠️ Ultra-Scavenger Option (PLA/PETG only)\n\n\n\n\nThe following extruders were carefully evaluated but not selected as reference spec due to their dual-drive architecture, which introduces gear mesh artifacts that affect print quality consistency.\n\n\n\nDeveloped by Annex Engineering, the Sherpa Mini is the de facto standard for lightweight direct-drive in the Voron community. Uses BMG clone gears in a compact dual-drive configuration.\nSpecifications: | Attribute | Value | |———–|——-| | Gear Ratio | 5:1 (50:10) or 6.25:1 (50:8) | | Motor | Round NEMA14 pancake with pinion | | Weight | 110-127g complete | | Drive | ❌ BMG clone dual-drive |\nPros: - Extremely light (~120g) — no gantry sag - BMG gears ubiquitous ($3-8, available everywhere) - Massive community (PDF manual, Discord, years of refinement) - Dual-drive excellent for TPU - Battle-tested (thousands in service) - Printable body\nCons: - ❌ Dual-drive architecture — gear mesh artifacts affect consistency - Requires specific NEMA14 pancake motor with integrated pinion (~$14-21 AUD) - Heat-set inserts require soldering iron - BMG quality varies by vendor - Motor not scavengeable from donor printers\nCost Breakdown: | Component | Cost (AUD) | |———–|————| | BMG clone gear set | $3-8 | | Round NEMA14 pancake motor | $14-21 | | Hardware, inserts, PTFE | ~$5 | | Total | $22-34 |\nEngineering Analysis:\nRod sag calculations (250mm span): - M8 rods + Sherpa (NEMA14): ~0.015mm sag (excellent)\nThe Sherpa Mini is mechanically excellent. Its rejection for Amalgam is purely architectural — the dual-drive design conflicts with our quality philosophy.\nVerdict: Excellent extruder for builders who prioritize TPU capability and lightweight toolheads over absolute extrusion consistency. Not selected due to dual-drive architecture and non-scavengeable motor.\nStatus: ❌ Not Recommended (dual-drive architecture)\n\n\n\n\nThe Sherpa Micro is an even more compact version of the Sherpa Mini, designed for the smallest possible toolhead footprint.\nSpecifications: | Attribute | Value | |———–|——-| | Gear Ratio | ~4:1 | | Motor | Round NEMA14 pancake with 6T pinion | | Weight | ~85g complete | | Drive | ❌ Dual-drive (BMG-style) |\nPros: - Extremely compact and lightweight (~85g) - Excellent for space-constrained builds - Printable body - Good community support (shares ecosystem with Sherpa Mini)\nCons: - ❌ Dual-drive architecture — gear mesh artifacts - Requires specific NEMA14 motor with integrated pinion (~$14-21 AUD) - Motor not scavengeable - Less torque than Sherpa Mini due to smaller gearing\nCost Breakdown: | Component | Cost (AUD) | |———–|————| | BMG clone gear set | $3-8 | | Round NEMA14 pancake motor (6T) | $14-21 | | Hardware, inserts | ~$3-5 | | Total | $20-34 |\nVerdict: Even more compact than Sherpa Mini but shares the same dual-drive limitation. The smaller gearing also reduces torque headroom.\nStatus: ❌ Not Recommended (dual-drive architecture)\n\n\n\n\nThe Orbiter is a high-performance planetary geared extruder designed by Róbert Lőrincz in cooperation with LDO Motors. Features an innovative orbiting gear mechanism.\nSpecifications: | Attribute | Value | |———–|——-| | Gear Ratio | 7.5:1 (planetary) | | Motor | LDO-36STH20-1004AHG (specific motor required) | | Weight | ~140-150g complete | | Drive | ❌ Dual-drive planetary | | Filament Force | Up to 9.4kg pushing force |\nPros: - Very high gear ratio (7.5:1) in compact package - Excellent filament pushing force - High-quality injection molded housing (glass-fiber reinforced nylon) - Good for high-speed printing and flexible filaments - Proven design with strong community\nCons: - ❌ Dual-drive architecture — planetary gears still mesh - Requires specific LDO motor (~$50-75 AUD) — not scavengeable - Expensive complete kit (~$75-100 AUD) - Proprietary gears — clone quality questionable (~$10 AUD but risky) - Injection molded parts — not printable for repairs\nCost Breakdown: | Component | Cost (AUD) | |———–|————| | Orbiter v1.5 kit with motor | $75-100 | | OR: Clone gears + LDO motor | $10 + $50-75 | | Total | $60-100 |\nEngineering Analysis:\nThe Orbiter’s 7.5:1 ratio provides exceptional torque from a small motor, enabling high acceleration extrusion. However, the planetary gear system is still dual-drive — two gears grip the filament, introducing mesh artifacts.\nVerdict: Excellent high-performance extruder, but the specific motor requirement, cost, and dual-drive architecture exclude it from Amalgam consideration. The clone gears available on AliExpress (~$10) are a quality gamble.\nStatus: ❌ Not Recommended (dual-drive, specific motor, cost)\n\n\n\n\nThe Bondtech LGX Lite is a commercial extruder using Bondtech’s “Large Gears eXtruder” technology with oversized drive gears for increased filament contact.\nSpecifications: | Attribute | Value | |———–|——-| | Gear Ratio | ~3.5:1 (44:10, 37:17 compound) | | Motor | Round NEMA14 36mm pancake | | Weight | ~150-165g complete | | Drive | ❌ Dual-drive (Bondtech LGX gears) | | Filament Tension | 3-position lever (open/rigid/flexible) |\nPros: - High-quality commercial product - Large drive gears (18mm Ø) = 50% more filament contact area - Excellent tension adjustment system - Good for flexible filaments - Professional injection-molded PA12 housing\nCons: - ❌ Dual-drive architecture — two meshing gears - Expensive — ~$120-150 AUD complete with motor - Commercial product — no printed parts, no customization - Requires specific NEMA14 motor (~$25-35 AUD) - Not scavengeable, not repairable with printed parts\nCost Breakdown: | Component | Cost (AUD) | |———–|————| | LGX Lite V2 with motor | $120-150 | | LGX Lite V2 without motor | $85-100 | | NEMA14 36mm motor | $25-35 | | Total | $120-150 |\nVerdict: Premium commercial option with excellent build quality, but the cost exceeds our entire extruder budget, and the dual-drive architecture conflicts with our quality philosophy.

    "text": "“The Sherpa Mini is mechanically excellent, but it has two issues for Amalgam: First, its dual-drive architecture introduces gear mesh artifacts that affect extrusion consistency — the same reason Bambu Lab uses single-drive. Second, it requires a specific NEMA14 pancake motor that can’t be scavenged. The Pitan delivers cleaner extrusion with motors from any donor printer.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Fair skepticism! The effect is subtle but measurable — periodic micro-variations in extrusion pressure as gear teeth mesh and unmesh. For most printing it’s invisible. But Amalgam targets quality over speed, and the single-drive architecture removes one variable from the quality equation. It’s also why Bambu Lab — known for print quality — uses single-drive designs.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Orbiter is excellent for high-speed printing where you need rapid extrusion acceleration. But Amalgam targets 80-120mm/s where the Pitan’s 3:1 ratio is plenty. The Orbiter also requires a specific $50-75 LDO motor and costs $75-100 complete. For our philosophy, the Pitan’s $4-10 with scavenged motor makes more sense.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Wade’s 5.22:1 ratio provides impressive torque, but it was designed for 3.00mm filament. The adapted 1.75mm filament path has too much exposure — TPU will buckle and jam. With a pancake motor it’s M8-compatible and makes a fine heritage option for PLA/PETG, but the Pitan handles all materials better.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Voron extruders are designed for 300mm/s+ racing with dual-drive BMG gears. Amalgam targets 80-120mm/s quality printing with single-drive consistency. The $60-120 cost of a Clockwork 2 kit equals our entire extruder budget plus half the frame. We’d rather spend that money on a better heated bed or quality thermistors.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Absolutely! The Pitan is our reference spec, but you’re a maker — use what you have. If there’s a Sherpa, Orbiter, or BMG in your parts bin, use it. The dual-drive concerns are about optimal quality for new builds, not a condemnation of existing equipment. The documentation is a starting point, not a constraint.”",

This document covers the X-carriage (“The Plough”), Y-axis gantry system, and motion components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike bed-slingers (where the bed moves in Y), a Z-Drop design:\n\nBed: Stationary in X-Y, moves only vertically (Z) on its own independent system\nGantry: X-axis assembly moves front-to-back along Y-rods (fixed height)\nMotion: The “Plough” (X-carriage) moves left-right, the gantry moves front-back\nZ-Axis: Completely separate — bed drops down as layers are printed\n\nKey Point: The X-Y gantry and Z-axis are independent systems. The gantry never moves vertically.\nBenefits: - Heavy bed isn’t moving back and forth (reduces “ringing”) - Higher print speeds possible - Better for large, heavy heated beds - Gantry stays at fixed height (simpler belt paths)\n\n\n\nTop of Frame (Fixed Height - X-Y Motion):\n┌─────────────────────────────────┐\n│  [Y-Motor]     Y-Rods    [Y-Motor]  ← Dual Y steppers\n│       ════════════════════       ← Y-rods fixed to top frame\n│       ↑                  ↑\n│    [X-End]            [X-End]    ← Slide on Y-rods (front-back)\n│       ├── X-Rods (60mm) ─┤       ← Carried by X-Ends\n│       │   [THE PLOUGH]   │       ← Slides on X-rods (left-right)\n│       │    Pitan + V6    │\n└───────┴──────────────────┴──────┘\n\nInside Frame (Separate Z Motion):\n┌─────────────────────────────────┐\n│                                 │\n│  Z-Rods (M8/M10 smooth)         │  ← Vertical guide rods\n│  ↕ Triple-Z lead screws         │  ← Drive bed up/down\n│      [Heated Bed Platform]      │  ← Moves ONLY in Z\n│                                 │\n└─────────────────────────────────┘\n\nThe X-Y gantry and Z-bed are INDEPENDENT systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tractor uses two Y-steppers (one per side) instead of a single motor with sync shaft:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nSingle Motor + Sync Shaft\nDual Y Steppers\n\n\n\n\nParts\n1 Motor, Long Rod, 2-4 Bearings, 2 Couplers\n2 Motors, 2 Pulleys\n\n\nComplexity\nHigh (shaft must be parallel)\nLow (self-contained units)\n\n\nScavenger Factor\nHard to find straight 500mm rod\nEasy—second motor from donor\n\n\nRobustness\nAdds rotational slop over distance\nDouble torque for heavy gantry\n\n\nKlipper Edge\nManual squaring only\nAuto-squaring every home\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe killer feature of dual Y motors:\n\nPlace one endstop on left Y-rail, one on right Y-rail\nWhen printer homes, both motors move toward back\nLeft side hits switch first → stops\nRight side continues until it hits its switch\nResult: Gantry is square to frame within 0.01mm\n\nThis level of precision is nearly impossible with a manual sync shaft.\n\n\n\nFor Dual-Y + Triple-Z: - 1 driver for X - 2 drivers for Y (Y and Y1) - 3 drivers for Z (Z, Z1, Z2) - 1 driver for Extruder\nTotal: 7 Drivers\nOptions: - MKS SKIP + expansion board (SKR Pico) - Two donor mainboards via Klipper Multi-MCU - Hard-wire Y-motors in series (loses auto-square)\n\n\n\nThe Y-motors sit at top corners of the box frame:\n# Integrated Y-Motor Mount\nmotor_offset = 45  # Distance from frame center to motor shaft\n\nwith BuildPart() as y_motor_mount:\n    # 1.

Current canonical decisions are in: - ADR-025: Multi-Frame Architecture (Scaffold, Mill, Lathe paths) - ADR-026: Donor Fitness & Frame Constraints (bed size, Z-height tiers) - ADR-000: Engineering Philosophy (core “Tractor” principles)\nThis deep-dive is useful for understanding how we arrived at the simplified two-donor model, but refer to ADRs above for current guidance.\n\n\n\nAmalgam is a tribute to the original RepRap Darwin printer—a “Tractor with a Racecar Brain” built from scavenged parts, M10 threaded rods, and the Klipper firmware. It prioritizes understanding, repairability, and the satisfaction of building something with your hands.\nBut it’s not for everyone.\nThis guide will help you honestly assess whether Amalgam is the right project for you, or whether you’d be better served buying a commercial printer.\n\n\n\n\nThe 3D printer market has fundamentally changed since the RepRap era:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEra\nDIY Build Cost\nBest Commercial Option\nDIY Advantage\n\n\n\n\n2007 (Darwin)\n~$1,000\n$10,000+ (Stratasys)\nOnly option for hobbyists\n\n\n2012 (Mendel i2)\n~$500\n$2,000+ (MakerBot)\nMassive cost savings\n\n\n2018 (Ender era)\n~$300\n$200 (Ender 3)\nLearning experience only\n\n\n2025 (Today)\n~$200+\n$180 (Ender 3 V3 SE)\nNone (economically)\n\n\n\nThe brutal truth: If you need to purchase most of the parts for Amalgam, you cannot compete with Chinese manufacturing on cost, and increasingly not on quality either.\n\n\nBudget options that didn’t exist a few years ago:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinter\nPrice\nQuality\nSpeed\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nCreality Ender 3 V3 SE\n~$180\nGood\nModerate\nHard to beat on value\n\n\nCreality Ender 3 V3 KE\n~$250\nGood\nFast\nKlipper pre-installed\n\n\nElegoo Neptune 4\n~$200\nGood\nFast\nKlipper-based\n\n\nQIDI X-Smart 3\n~$350\nVery Good\nFast\nEnclosed, CoreXY\n\n\nBambu Lab A1 Mini\n~$250\nExcellent\nVery Fast\n“It just works”\n\n\nBambu Lab A1\n~$400\nExcellent\nVery Fast\nLarger build volume\n\n\n\nEven Creality and QIDI are approaching Bambu Lab quality in their newer models. The gap is closing rapidly.\n\n\n\nBefore recommending any printer, we need to address something important: not all printers are created equal in terms of openness.\n\n\nBambu Lab makes excellent printers. They “just work.” But there’s a trade-off:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\nBambu Lab Approach\nWhy It Matters\n\n\n\n\nFirmware\nClosed source, encrypted\nYou can’t modify or fully understand it\n\n\nCloud dependency\nOptional but pushed\nSome features require Bambu Cloud account\n\n\nRepair parts\nProprietary components\nLimited third-party options\n\n\nModifications\nDiscouraged, may void warranty\nLess hackable than open alternatives\n\n\nData collection\nTelemetry enabled by default\nPrivacy considerations\n\n\nLongevity\nDepends on company support\nIf Bambu disappears, so does support\n\n\n\nThis isn’t necessarily bad — many users happily trade openness for convenience. The printer works, prints are excellent, and they don’t care about modifying it.\nBut if you value: - Right to repair - Understanding your tools - Privacy and data ownership - Long-term independence from any company - The maker/hacker ethos\nThen Bambu’s closed ecosystem may not align with your values, regardless of print quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinter\nOpenness\nTrade-off\n\n\n\n\nPrusa (Original)\nFully open source hardware & firmware\nSlower than Bambu, higher price\n\n\nVoron (Self-sourced)\n100% open, community-driven\nYou build it yourself\n\n\nCreality (Klipper models)\nOpen firmware, mixed hardware\nQuality inconsistent\n\n\nElegoo/QIDI\nMostly open (Klipper-based)\nSome proprietary elements\n\n\nAmalgam\n100% open, scavenger-friendly\nYou build it yourself\n\n\n\nOur stance: We mention Bambu Lab because they make genuinely good printers, and honesty requires acknowledging that. But we also believe you should know what you’re trading away. Make an informed choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to build a printer but also want speed, precision, and reliability, there’s another path: Voron.\n\n\nVoron is a family of open-source, self-sourced CoreXY printers designed by enthusiasts for enthusiasts. They’re the “high-end DIY” option:\n\n\n\nVoron Model\nBuild Volume\nStyle\nTypical Cost\n\n\n\n\nVoron 0.2\n120×120×120\nTiny, enclosed\n$400-600\n\n\nVoron Trident\n250-350mm³\nEnclosed, triple-Z\n$1,000-1,500\n\n\nVoron 2.4\n250-350mm³\nEnclosed, flying gantry\n$1,200-1,800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor\nVoron\nAmalgam\n\n\n\n\nGoal\nBest possible DIY printer\nLearn, scavenge, understand\n\n\nFrame\nAluminum extrusion (purchased)\nM10 threaded rod (hardware store)\n\n\nMotion\nLinear rails (MGN9/12)\nSmooth rods (scavenged)\n\n\nSpeed\n300-500mm/s capable\n100-200mm/s comfortable\n\n\nPrecision\nExcellent\nGood (with tuning)\n\n\nCost\n$800-1,800 (self-sourced)\n$85-170 (with parts bin)\n\n\nBuild time\n40-80 hours\n20-40 hours\n\n\nScavenger-friendly\nNo (specific parts required)\nYes (that’s the point)\n\n\nCommunity\nLarge, active, helpful\nAmalgam specific\n\n\nPhilosophy\n“Best DIY printer possible”\n“Understand your machine”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Voron if: - You want DIY and top-tier performance - You’re willing to invest $1,000+ in quality parts - You want speed (300mm/s+) from a self-built machine - You enjoy precision assembly and tuning - You have time for a 40-80 hour build\nChoose Amalgam if: - You prioritize learning over performance - You have a parts bin to use - You want the cheapest viable path - You value the “scavenger” philosophy - You want something simpler to understand\n\n\n\nVoron is often described as “cheaper than buying a Bambu” — this is misleading:\n\n\n\nVoron 2.4 Cost Breakdown\nTypical Range\n\n\n\n\nFrame (aluminum extrusion)\n$150-250\n\n\nLinear rails (×7)\n$100-300\n\n\nElectronics (Octopus, Pi, etc.)\n$150-250\n\n\nMotors (×6-7)\n$80-150\n\n\nHotend + Extruder\n$80-200\n\n\nHeated bed + SSR\n$80-150\n\n\nPanels, hardware, misc\n$150-300\n\n\nTotal\n$800-1,600\n\n\n\nPlus 40-80 hours of your time.\nA Bambu Lab P1S costs $600 and prints out of the box.\nVoron makes sense if you value the build process and want maximum performance from a DIY machine. It doesn’t make sense purely as a cost-saving measure.\n\n\n\nAmalgam and Voron serve different purposes:\n\nVoron: “I want to build the best printer I can”\nAmalgam: “I want to understand printers and use what I have”\n\nMany makers own both — a Voron for production, a Amalgam for the joy of building and learning. They’re complementary philosophies, not competing ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk yourself honestly:\nWhat do I actually want?\n│\n├─► \"I want to HAVE a 3D printer\"\n│   │\n│   ├─► I need speed and reliability, don't care about openness\n│   │   └─► Bambu Lab A1 or P1S (but read \"Open vs Closed\" section)\n│   │\n│   ├─► I need speed and reliability, AND value open source\n│   │   └─► Prusa XL, or build a Voron\n│   │\n│   ├─► I need quality but not speed\n│   │   └─► Buy a used Prusa MK3S+ ($300-400)\n│   │\n│   ├─► I need cheap and functional\n│   │   └─► Buy an Ender 3 V3 SE (~$180)\n│   │\n│   └─► I want Klipper out of the box\n│       └─► Buy an Ender 3 V3 KE or Neptune 4\n│\n└─► \"I want to BUILD a 3D printer\"\n    │\n    ├─► I want the BEST DIY printer possible\n    │   └─► Build a Voron (but budget $1,000+)\n    │\n    ├─► I have a parts bin (dead printers, scavenged rods, etc.)\n    │   └─► Amalgam is for you ✓\n    │\n    ├─► I want to deeply understand how printers work\n    │   └─► Amalgam is for you ✓\n    │\n    ├─► I enjoy the build process itself\n    │   └─► Amalgam or Voron (depending on budget)\n    │\n    ├─► I need to buy most/all parts\n    │   └─► Reconsider—Voron if budget allows, else buy commercial\n    │\n    └─► I want a project but have limited budget\n        └─► Amalgam with patience (accumulate parts first)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have: - One or two dead Enders/Anets in the closet - A drawer of NEMA 17 steppers - Smooth rods from a photocopier teardown - Random bearings, belts, and electronics\nFor you: Amalgam turns that junk into a functional, capable printer. The “cost” is already sunk—now it’s just time and learning.\n\n\n\nYou want: - To understand how a 3D printer works, not just use one - A teaching tool for mechanics, electronics, and firmware - A project that forces engagement with every subsystem\nFor you: Amalgam is a learning platform. Building it teaches more than any YouTube video or manual ever could.\n\n\n\nYou believe: - Disposable tech is wasteful - A machine should be fixable with basic tools - Understanding your tools makes you a better maker\nFor you: Amalgam is designed for 20-year repairability. Every part is replaceable, understandable, and sourceable from a hardware store.\n\n\n\nYou already: - Own a Bambu or Prusa that “just works” - Want a project, not a product - Enjoy the satisfaction of “I made this”\nFor you: Amalgam is the journey, not the destination. The printer at the end is a bonus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your goal is to download STLs and press print, buy a commercial printer. Amalgam will frustrate you—it requires tuning, understanding, and patience.\nBetter choice: Bambu Lab A1 Mini ($250) — genuinely “it just works”\n\n\n\nIf you’re building Amalgam to “save money” but need to buy: - Stepper motors (~$40-60 for 7) - Smooth rods (~$30-50) - Linear bearings (~$20-30) - Control boards (~$30-50) - Power supplies (~$30-50) - Heated bed (~$30-40) - Hotend (~$20-40) - Belts, pulleys, hardware (~$30-50)\nTotal: $230-370 — and you still need to build it.\nBetter choice: Ender 3 V3 SE ($180) — arrives assembled, works immediately\n\n\n\nAmalgam philosophy: Quality over Speed\nIf you want 500mm/s printing with 20,000mm/s² acceleration, Amalgam’s heavy M10 gantry and sled design is the wrong architecture.\nBetter choice: Bambu Lab P1S or Voron 2.4\n\n\n\nIf you need a working printer by next week for a project, do not start Amalgam. It’s a journey measured in weeks or months, not days.\nBetter choice: Any commercial printer with 2-day shipping\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many people reading this, the honest best answer is:\nBuy a used Prusa MK3S+ for $300-400\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor\nPrusa MK3S+\nAmalgam\n\n\n\n\nTime to first print\n1-2 hours (assembly/calibration)\nWeeks to months\n\n\nPrint quality\nExcellent\nGood (with tuning)\n\n\nReliability\nProven over years\nDepends on your build\n\n\nCommunity support\nMassive\nAmalgam specific only\n\n\nKlipper compatible\nYes (flash it)\nYes (native)\n\n\nRepairability\nExcellent\nExcellent\n\n\nSpeed\nModerate\nModerate\n\n\nLearning experience\nModerate\nExtensive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prusa MK4 is now available, which means: - MK3S+ units flooding the used market - Prices dropping ($300-400 currently, likely lower soon) - Proven machines with known reliability - Huge parts availability\nThe MK3 shares Amalgam’s philosophy (quality over speed, repairability, open source) without the build time investment.\n\n\n\n\nYou want to print, not build\nYou value your time highly\nYou don’t have a significant parts bin\nYou want proven reliability immediately\nYou’re not driven by the learning experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmalgam uses a “Tier” system to help you assess your starting point:\n\n\nBefore building anything:\n\nAssess what you already have (parts bin inventory)\nAssess what you’d need to buy\nCalculate true cost (parts + time)\nCompare against commercial options\nMake an honest decision\n\nIf Tier 0 analysis says “don’t build” — that’s a valid outcome. The goal is to help you make the right choice, not convince you to build Amalgam regardless.\n\n\n\nIf you have a working older printer (Prusa MK2/MK3, Ender 3, etc.):\nConsider just upgrading it: - Flash Klipper firmware - Add input shaping (ADXL345) - Add dual-Z if single-Z - Tune pressure advance\nThis might be all you need. A Klipper-upgraded Ender 3 is a very capable machine.\n\n\n\nIf you have: - Significant parts bin (2+ donor printers worth) - Time to invest (weeks to months) - Desire to learn deeply - Acceptance that commercial options are “better” on paper\nThen Amalgam is for you. Build the Tractor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have two dead Enders and a photocopier teardown:\n\n\n\nComponent\nSource\nCost\n\n\n\n\nSteppers (7x)\nDonor printers\n$0\n\n\nSmooth rods\nPhotocopier\n$0\n\n\nControl boards\nDonor printers\n$0\n\n\nPSUs\nDonor printers\n$0\n\n\nHeated bed\nDonor printer\n$0\n\n\nHotend\nDonor printer (or buy)\n$0-30\n\n\nM10 threaded rod\nHardware store\n$20-30\n\n\nMDF base\nHardware store\n$15-25\n\n\nBearings\nMay need to buy\n$15-30\n\n\nHardware (nuts, bolts)\nHardware store\n$20-30\n\n\nBelts, pulleys\nMay need to buy\n$15-25\n\n\nTotal\n\n$85-170\n\n\n\nVerdict: Makes sense—you’re mostly investing time, not money.\n\n\n\nYou have enthusiasm but few parts:\n\n\n\nComponent\nSource\nCost\n\n\n\n\nSteppers (7x)\nAliExpress\n$45-60\n\n\nSmooth rods (M10)\nAliExpress/local\n$30-50\n\n\nControl boards (2x)\nAliExpress\n$40-60\n\n\nPSUs\nAliExpress\n$35-50\n\n\nHeated bed\nAliExpress\n$25-40\n\n\nHotend (V6 clone)\nAliExpress\n$15-25\n\n\nM10 threaded rod\nHardware store\n$20-30\n\n\nMDF base\nHardware store\n$15-25\n\n\nBearings (LM10UU)\nAliExpress\n$15-25\n\n\nHardware\nHardware store\n$25-40\n\n\nBelts, pulleys\nAliExpress\n$20-30\n\n\nWiring, connectors\nVarious\n$20-30\n\n\nTotal\n\n$305-465\n\n\n\nVerdict: Questionable—you’re spending commercial printer money for a DIY result.\n\n\n\nAsk yourself: “At what parts cost does buying make more sense?”\nOur suggestion: If you need to spend more than $150 on parts, seriously consider the commercial alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n✅ A project, not a product — The build is the point\n✅ Deep understanding — You’ll know every nut, bolt, and line of config\n✅ Repairability for decades — Hardware store parts, no proprietary components\n✅ The satisfaction of creation — “I made this with my hands”\n✅ Learning platform — Mechanics, electronics, firmware, calibration\n✅ Parts bin redemption — Turn junk into a functional tool\n\n\n\n❌ Cost savings — If buying parts, commercial is cheaper\n❌ Better performance — A Bambu will outperform it on speed\n❌ Faster time-to-printing — Weeks vs. hours\n❌ Warranty or support — You’re on your own (with community help)\n❌ Plug-and-play experience — Requires tuning and understanding\n❌ Impressive specs — It’s a Tractor, not a race car\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have a meaningful parts bin (50%+ of components)\nYou want to understand printers, not just use them\nYou enjoy the build process itself\nYou accept it won’t match commercial performance\nYou value repairability and longevity\nYou’re not in a hurry\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to buy most parts (buy commercial instead)\nYou just want to print things (buy a Bambu)\nYou need speed (buy a CoreXY)\nYou need it working soon (buy anything commercial)\nYou’ll be frustrated if it’s not “the best”\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a used Prusa MK3S+ ($300-400) — Same philosophy, proven design\nFlash Klipper on an existing printer — Upgrade what you have\nWait and accumulate parts — Start Amalgam when your parts bin is ready\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmalgam is a passion project for builders, tinkerers, and learners.

The gap is closing rapidly.\n\n\n\nBefore recommending any printer, we need to address something important: not all printers are created equal in terms of openness.\n\n\nBambu Lab makes excellent printers. They “just work.” But there’s a trade-off:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\nBambu Lab Approach\nWhy It Matters\n\n\n\n\nFirmware\nClosed source, encrypted\nYou can’t modify or fully understand it\n\n\nCloud dependency\nOptional but pushed\nSome features require Bambu Cloud account\n\n\nRepair parts\nProprietary components\nLimited third-party options\n\n\nModifications\nDiscouraged, may void warranty\nLess hackable than open alternatives\n\n\nData collection\nTelemetry enabled by default\nPrivacy considerations\n\n\nLongevity\nDepends on company support\nIf Bambu disappears, so does support\n\n\n\nThis isn’t necessarily bad — many users happily trade openness for convenience. The printer works, prints are excellent, and they don’t care about modifying it.\nBut if you value: - Right to repair - Understanding your tools - Privacy and data ownership - Long-term independence from any company - The maker/hacker ethos\nThen Bambu’s closed ecosystem may not align with your values, regardless of print quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinter\nOpenness\nTrade-off\n\n\n\n\nPrusa (Original)\nFully open source hardware & firmware\nSlower than Bambu, higher price\n\n\nVoron (Self-sourced)\n100% open, community-driven\nYou build it yourself\n\n\nCreality (Klipper models)\nOpen firmware, mixed hardware\nQuality inconsistent\n\n\nElegoo/QIDI\nMostly open (Klipper-based)\nSome proprietary elements\n\n\nAmalgam\n100% open, scavenger-friendly\nYou build it yourself\n\n\n\nOur stance: We mention Bambu Lab because they make genuinely good printers, and honesty requires acknowledging that. But we also believe you should know what you’re trading away. Make an informed choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to build a printer but also want speed, precision, and reliability, there’s another path: Voron.\n\n\nVoron is a family of open-source, self-sourced CoreXY printers designed by enthusiasts for enthusiasts.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The fused deposition modeling (FDM) industry has entered a period of profound structural realignment. For over a decade, the desktop 3D printing market was defined by the tension between the enthusiast’s desire for tinkering and the prosumer’s need for reliability. This landscape was historically dominated by the RepRap movement and its commercial offspring, Prusa Research.1 However, the emergence of vertically integrated manufacturers like Bambu Lab has created a “closed-source matrix” where users trade technological sovereignty for out-of-the-box speed.3\nAmalgam is a project aimed at “waking up” the maker community by the March 2027 20th anniversary of the original RepRap Darwin (first released in March 2007). This report analyzes the technical feasibility of returning to open-source roots through a two-donor, scavenger-friendly design with multiple frame paths adapted to what builders can salvage.\n\n\nThe RepRap project, initiated by Dr. Adrian Bowyer in 2004, sought to democratize manufacturing via self-replicating machines. The RepRap 1.0 “Darwin”, released in early 2007, proved the viability of this vision by printing over half of its own components. By May 2008, Darwin achieved full self-replication, birthing the first “child” machine.\nWhile subsequent iterations like the Mendel (2009) and the Prusa i3 (2012) simplified the assembly, the industry eventually diverged into a “race to the bottom” with cheap clones and a “race to the top” with integrated appliances.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEra\nKey Model\nMechanical Standard\nParadigm\n\n\n\n\nGenesis (2007-2008)\nRepRap Darwin\nM8 Rods (Cube)\nRadical Self-Replication\n\n\nStandard (2013-2018)\nPrusa i3 MK3\nAluminum Plates\nReliable Bed-Slinger\n\n\nIntegrated (2023-Present)\nBambu Lab X1/P1\nProprietary CoreXY\nIntegrated Appliance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor makers in high-cost regions like Australia, the “affordable” $800 USD printer typically costs $1,300 to $1,500 AUD, making quality printing a significant financial barrier.6 Even the entry-level Bambu Lab A1 Mini, while priced at ~$319 AUD, often leads to “buyer’s remorse” due to its limited 180mm cube build volume.8\nAmalgam addresses this by aiming for a $300 AUD budget for a machine with 220×220×220mm build volume, utilizing a two-donor scavenger strategy to maximize accessibility.\n\n\n\nTo achieve high-quality prints at low cost, Amalgam returns to the “JunkStrap” philosophy—cobbling together high-performance machines from scavenged materials. The key insight: two donor printers provide nearly everything you need.\n\n\nRather than prescribing a single frame design, Amalgam offers three paths based on what you scavenged:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPath\nFrame\nMotion\nBest Donors\nCost\n\n\n\n\nScaffold\nM10 Threaded Rod + MDF\nSmooth Rods + LM8UU\nAnet A8, Wanhao, Prusa clones\n~$190-230\n\n\nMill\nAluminum Extrusion + MDF\nV-Slots + POM Wheels\nEnder 3, CR-10\n~$160-185\n\n\nLathe\nAluminum Extrusion + MDF\nSmooth Rods + IGUS\nMixed donors\n~$235-280\n\n\n\nThe Scaffold path is the spiritual heir to RepRap Darwin — M10 threaded rods forming a box-frame skeleton. The significant mass of steel provides superior vibration damping, essential for high-speed FDM.

    "text": "The Amalgam Context: Sovereignty in the Age of the Appliance\nEntering 2026, the 3D printing market has split into two extremes: ultra-fast “appliances” like the Bambu Lab X1C or Prusa MK4, and specialized high-end DIY projects that often require deep pockets and expensive linear rails. For many enthusiasts, these options are financially out of reach or offer a “black-box” experience that discourages true tinkering.\nProject Amalgam exists in the space between these worlds. It distills 20 years of RepRap evolution into a “Reference Specification” that prioritizes battle-tested reliability over chasing the latest marketing hype.\n\nThe Philosophy of “Proven Iron”\nAmalgam rejects the “innovation for innovation’s sake” cycle. Instead, it picks the most reliable components from the history of 3D printing:\n\nThe “Tractor” Extruder: We use the Pitan, a 3:1 geared extruder descended from Greg’s Wade. While modern direct drives are more compact, a geared NEMA17 delivers superior torque and reliable filament grip — especially with salvaged motors.\nFilament Logic: The Pitan is optimized for 1.75mm filament, combining the high mechanical advantage of geared extrusion with the superior availability and lower cost of modern 1.75mm materials.\nThe Hotend: We standardize on the E3D V6 across all frame paths. By specifying one hotend for every Amalgam build — Scaffold, Mill, or Lathe — we ensure consistent print quality and a shared set of community print profiles.\n\n\n\nThe 2nd Hand Market Reality (2026)\nOne of the core drivers for the Amalgam project is the current distortion in the used printer market.\n\nThe Prusa “Premium” Trap: Many used Prusa MK3 units are currently listed for $450+ AUD based on their original high purchase price. At that price, they are objectively a poor value compared to a new Bambu Lab A1, which offers similar reliability with significantly higher speeds and modern features for a similar cost.\nThe “Grab it” Threshold: If you find a functional MK3 for under $300 AUD, grab it. That is the point where the hardware value aligns with the effort. If it is broken, however, do not use it as a donor; the cost of individual replacement parts will quickly exceed the budget of a fresh Amalgam build.\n\n\n\nWho is this for?\nThe Amalgam is for those who value Mechanical Sovereignty.\n\nThe Budget-Conscious: You want a machine that rivals a $1,000 printer’s quality but only have $160-280 AUD to spend.\nThe Tinkerer: You enjoy the engineering challenge of building a “Tractor with a Racecar’s Brain”—a machine you can fix with parts from a hardware store.\nThe Salvager: You believe that high-performance manufacturing should be possible using e-waste and ingenuity rather than proprietary cloud-locked subscriptions.\n\n\n“If you want an appliance, buy a Bambu. If you want a tool that you truly own—and one that will still be printing in a decade—build an Amalgam.”\n\n\n\nA Practical Guide to Salvage, Speed, and the “Good Enough” Machine\n\n\n1. The “Race to the Bottom” vs. The “Prusa Standard”\nThis document categorizes donor machines based on their mechanical soul.\n\nThe Rebuild Mandate: Machines from the “Race to the Bottom” era—Anet A8, Tevo Tarantula, and early Creality clones—were built with cost as the only metric. They often suffer from flexing acrylic frames or unstable V-slot rollers that lead to a constant cycle of maintenance. These are the primary candidates for an Amalgam rebirth.\nThe Immortal MK2 Exception: The Prusa MK2, while old and running on a 12V system, was built with a philosophy of rigidity. If a MK2 is square and functional, it is often better to keep it as a reliable “Second Chair” printer rather than tearing it down. Its quality is already “acceptable” for most functional parts, and the time saved on tinkering can be spent elsewhere.\nThe “Grab it” Threshold: If you find a functional MK3 for under $300 AUD, grab it. That is the point where the hardware value aligns with the effort. If it is broken, however, do not use it as a donor; the cost of individual replacement parts will quickly exceed the budget of a fresh Amalgam build.\n\n\n\n2. Chasing Quality vs. Chasing Speed\nModern marketing has convinced users that if they aren’t printing at 600mm/s, they are failing.\n\nThe Speed Trap: Chasing the “Racecar” speeds of a Bambu or a Voron requires lightweight toolheads and expensive linear rails.\nThe Quality Baseline: The Amalgam, like the MK2, prioritizes a 70-120mm/s baseline. This “Tractor” pace ensures dimensional accuracy and consistency that often outlasts the high-speed appliances.\nThe “Good Enough” Philosophy: If a machine prints accurately and reliably, “upgrading” it can sometimes be a step backward in productivity.\n\n\n\n3. The Value of “Industrial Vitamins”\nIf you do decide to use an older Prusa as a donor, you aren’t just getting scrap; you are getting “Industrial Vitamins.”\n\nProven Motors: The LDO motors found in authentic Prusa machines are battle-tested and often feature better internal dampening and torque curves than the “no-name” motors found in budget clones.\nThe Motor Math: Using these high-quality salvaged motors in an Amalgam frame provides a superior build.\n\n\n\n4. The 2026 Purchase Guide\n\nThe $300 Rule: If you see a functional MK3 for under $300 AUD, buy it and use it. It is a “set-and-forget” workhorse.\nThe Bambu Comparison: Do not pay $450 AUD for a used MK3 when a new Bambu A1 is nearly the same price and significantly more capable.\nThe DIY Threshold: If you cannot find a cheap Prusa and you refuse to buy a “cloud-locked” appliance, the Amalgam is the most cost-effective path to a high-precision, Triple-Z machine.\n\n\n\n\nSummary of the Philosophy\n\n“Build an Amalgam because you need a foundation. Keep a MK2 because you need a friend. But never chase a ‘Racecar’ price for a ‘Tractor’ experience.”",

The carriage can pivot, causing: - Nozzle angle variation - Layer misalignment - Inconsistent extrusion width\nDual rods solve this by creating a moment arm — the spacing between rods resists rotation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a simply supported beam with central point load:\nδ = F × L³ / (48 × E × I)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\nLoad per Rod\nRelative Deflection\n\n\n\n\nDual rods\nF/2\n1× (baseline)\n\n\nSingle rod\nF\n2×\n\n\n\nBut wait — it gets worse.\n\n\n\nWith dual rods, both rods deflect together, sharing the load.

    "text": "Accepted\n\n\n\n\n\nADR-025 established three frame paths (Scaffold, Mill, Lathe) to maximize donor compatibility. However, not all donors are equally suitable, even within a frame path.\nThe constraint is not the frame type (M10 threaded rod vs. extrusion), but rather two physical dimensions that affect system stability:\n\nBed size — determines frame footprint and lateral vibration damping\nZ height — affects resonant frequency and leveling stability\n\n\n\n\nBed Size Issue: - Larger beds require larger frame members or heavier damping - At the design limit (220×220mm reference), MDF base provides adequate mass damping - Beyond ~300×300mm, the frame-to-mass ratio degrades; print quality suffers from nozzle compliance\nZ-Height Issue: - Tall unsupported gantries have lower resonant frequencies - At printing speeds &gt;120mm/s, high nozzle deflection compounds acceleration errors - Bed leveling (Triple-Z) becomes less effective if gantry sag increases during acceleration\n\n\n\nCR-10 (300×300mm, 400mm Z): - Supported path: Mill (extrusions give lateral stiffness) - Issue: Taller than reference, larger bed = heavier MDF required - Mitigation: Swap heatbed for 220×220 (cost: $20-35) OR add 20mm thicker MDF\nTevo Spider (300×300mm, 500mm Z): - Unsupported deviation - Issue: Very tall + very wide = requires custom extrusion cuts + massive MDF base - Recommendation: Sell donor, buy matching pair (e.g., 2× Ender 3), or downsize bed\n\n\n\nUsing simplified model (underdamped oscillator on MDF):\nFundamental frequency of unsupported gantry:\nf ≈ (1/2π) × √(k / m)  [Hertz]\n\nwhere:\n  k = frame bending stiffness (N/m)\n  m = gantry mass (kg)\nFor our system: - M10 frame: k ≈ 50-100 N/μm (low stiffness, MDF compensates) - Extrusion frame: k ≈ 200-400 N/μm (stiffer, less MDF needed) - MDF damping: Raises effective m by ~40-60% (inertial coupling)\nResonance at print speeds: - 120mm/s = 2mm/min = 0.033Hz sweep - If f_natural &lt; 20Hz and damping ζ &lt; 0.3, ringing becomes visible - Klipper Input Shaping compensates, but foundation matters\nZ-axis stability: - Triple-Z leveling assumes &lt;2mm gantry sag across 220mm width - Tall gantries at high accel: 1-2mm sag is typical - Larger Z-drop distances amplify bed tilt errors (3mm sag over 400mm Z = 0.43° tilt per motor)\n\n\n\n\nWe establish fitness tiers based on bed size and Z-height:\n\n\nBed: 200–235mm square Z travel: &lt;280mm Donors: Anet A8, Wanhao i3, Prusa clones, Ender 3, Voxelab Aquila\nRequirements: - Standard 30–40mm MDF base - No modifications to frame or bed - All frame paths (Scaffold, Mill, Lathe) supported - Print quality guaranteed with Klipper tuning\nExamples: - 2× Anet A8: 220×220 bed, 240mm Z → ✅ Perfect - 2× Ender 3: 235×235 bed, 250mm Z → ✅ Excellent - Anet A8 + Ender 3: Mixed bed sizes (use 220 as reference) → ✅ Supported\n\n\n\nBed: 235–300mm square Z travel: 280–400mm Donors: CR-10, CR-10 V2, Artillery Sidewinder (larger models)\nRequirements: - Choose ONE mitigation: - Option A (Recommended): Swap heatbed to 220×220 ($20–35) - Option B: Use 50mm MDF base instead of standard 30–40mm (~$10 extra, heavier) - Option C: Reduce Z-travel height if gantry permits (unsupported deviation)\nNotes: - Extrusion-based frames (Mill) strongly preferred due to higher stiffness - Test with Klipper ADXL345 resonance measurement before full build - Expect slightly lower max acceleration (80–100mm/s² vs. 120mm/s² for Tier 1)\nExample: - 2× CR-10: 300×300 bed, 400mm Z - Mill path recommended - Suggested: Swap bed to 220×220 (cost: $25) → Frame: 220×220mm, MDF base stabilizes - OR: Heavier MDF (40–50mm) → ~$10 extra material\n\n\n\nBed: &gt;300mm or Z &gt;400mm Donors: Tevo Spider (500×500mm), old tall Tronxy models, Anet A2 (large)\nRecommendation: - Do not attempt as Amalgam - Instead: 1.

However, not all donors are equally suitable, even within a frame path.\nThe constraint is not the frame type (M10 threaded rod vs. extrusion), but rather two physical dimensions that affect system stability:\n\nBed size — determines frame footprint and lateral vibration damping\nZ height — affects resonant frequency and leveling stability\n\n\n\n\nBed Size Issue: - Larger beds require larger frame members or heavier damping - At the design limit (220×220mm reference), MDF base provides adequate mass damping - Beyond ~300×300mm, the frame-to-mass ratio degrades; print quality suffers from nozzle compliance\nZ-Height Issue: - Tall unsupported gantries have lower resonant frequencies - At printing speeds &gt;120mm/s, high nozzle deflection compounds acceleration errors - Bed leveling (Triple-Z) becomes less effective if gantry sag increases during acceleration\n\n\n\nCR-10 (300×300mm, 400mm Z): - Supported path: Mill (extrusions give lateral stiffness) - Issue: Taller than reference, larger bed = heavier MDF required - Mitigation: Swap heatbed for 220×220 (cost: $20-35) OR add 20mm thicker MDF\nTevo Spider (300×300mm, 500mm Z): - Unsupported deviation - Issue: Very tall + very wide = requires custom extrusion cuts + massive MDF base - Recommendation: Sell donor, buy matching pair (e.g., 2× Ender 3), or downsize bed\n\n\n\nUsing simplified model (underdamped oscillator on MDF):\nFundamental frequency of unsupported gantry:\nf ≈ (1/2π) × √(k / m)  [Hertz]\n\nwhere:\n  k = frame bending stiffness (N/m)\n  m = gantry mass (kg)\nFor our system: - M10 frame: k ≈ 50-100 N/μm (low stiffness, MDF compensates) - Extrusion frame: k ≈ 200-400 N/μm (stiffer, less MDF needed) - MDF damping: Raises effective m by ~40-60% (inertial coupling)\nResonance at print speeds: - 120mm/s = 2mm/min = 0.033Hz sweep - If f_natural &lt; 20Hz and damping ζ &lt; 0.3, ringing becomes visible - Klipper Input Shaping compensates, but foundation matters\nZ-axis stability: - Triple-Z leveling assumes &lt;2mm gantry sag across 220mm width - Tall gantries at high accel: 1-2mm sag is typical - Larger Z-drop distances amplify bed tilt errors (3mm sag over 400mm Z = 0.43° tilt per motor)"

    "text": "Accepted\n\n\n\nAmalgam’s scavenger philosophy requires that the heated bed come from donor printers. The dual-rod motion system (ADR-021) provides flexibility in build volume, but the bed size should align with what’s actually scavengeable.\n\n\nThe original config specified 250×250×250mm build volume, which is larger than any standard donor bed. This was aspirational rather than practical for scavenger builds.\n\n\n\nADR-021 (Dual-Rod Motion) and ADR-005 (Triple-Z) establish that Amalgam requires two donor printers for a practical scavenger build: - 6-7 NEMA17 motors needed (most donors have 4-5) - 8 smooth rods needed for Dual-8 configuration - Single donor cannot provide enough parts\nGiven two donors, the scavenger approach is: use the smaller of the two beds.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese donors provide both beds AND rods for the Dual-8 build:\n\n\n\nDonor Printer\nBed Size\nSmooth Rods\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPrusa i3 clones\n200×200mm\n6× 8mm\nOriginal RepRap lineage\n\n\nAnet A8\n220×220mm\n6× 8mm\nMassively popular, cheap\n\n\nAnet A6\n220×220mm\n6× 8mm\nSimilar to A8\n\n\nPrusa MK2\n250×210mm\n6× 8mm\nRectangular bed\n\n\nPrusa MK3/MK3S+\n250×210mm\n6× 8mm + 3× LM8LUU\nPremium donor\n\n\nTronxy X3\n220×220mm\n6× 8mm\nBudget option\n\n\nGeeetech i3\n200×200mm\n6× 8mm\nPrusa clone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese donors provide beds, motors, and electronics but no smooth rods:\n\n\n\nDonor Printer\nBed Size\nMotion System\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nEnder 3 / 3 Pro / 3 V2\n235×235mm\nV-slot rollers\nVery common\n\n\nEnder 5\n235×235mm\nV-slot rollers\nCube frame\n\n\nCR-10\n300×300mm\nV-slot rollers\nLarge format\n\n\nVoxelab Aquila\n235×235mm\nV-slot rollers\nEnder clone\n\n\nArtillery Sidewinder\n300×300mm\nV-slot rollers\nLarge format\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonor Printer\nBed Size\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPrusa Mini\n180×180mm\nSmall bed, cantilever design\n\n\nEnder 2\n150×150mm\nVery small\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 235×235mm bed is primarily associated with Creality Ender 3 series printers. However, Ender 3 uses V-slot rollers, not smooth rods.\nTo use a 235×235mm bed in a Dual-8 Amalgam: - One donor must be Ender 3 (provides bed, motors, board) - Other donor must be rod-bearing (provides rods, bearings) - This is a valid but mixed-donor configuration\nFor a pure rod-donor build (2× Prusa clones or 2× Anet A8), the 235×235mm bed is not available from scavenging.\n\n\n\n\nWe adopt 220×220mm as the reference specification heated bed size.\n\n\n\n\nThe Anet A8 was one of the most popular budget 3D printers ever sold, with millions of units.

Chamfer rod ends: File 45° bevel to avoid slicing IGUS internal ribs 2. Do NOT lubricate: IGUS bushings are self-lubricating; grease reduces life 3. Housing design: Include compliance gap for slight clamping pressure 4. Cutting stainless: Use angle grinder with thin “Inox” cutoff wheel\nVerdict: Excellent alternative for V-slot donors or silent builds. Not reference spec due to higher friction and cost, but a legitimate “premium” path.\nReferences: - Tom’s 3D IGUS analysis - IGUS Official Drylin RJ4JP\n\n\n\nDIY polymer sleeve bearings with split-clamp adjustment:\n    ┌─────────────┐\n    │  ╭───────╮  │  ← Printed PETG sleeve\n    │  │  rod  │  │\n    │  ╰───────╯  │\n    └──────┬──────┘\n         screw    ← Adjustable preload\nPros: - Zero cost (print them) - Adjustable preload compensates for wear - Works with slightly imperfect rods - Silent operation - True self-replication (RepRap philosophy)\nCons: - 2-3× higher friction than ball bearings - Requires careful tuning (too tight = binding, too loose = play) - Will wear over time - Needs periodic relubrication (PTFE grease, not oil) - Unproven at Amalgam’s 360mm spans\nBest candidate axis: Z (slowest, lowest risk)\nMaterial recommendation: PETG with PTFE/silicone grease\nVerdict: Experimental option for Z-axis.

Literate CAD Integration - With MkDocs: Manually run build123d, take screenshot, save image, link in markdown - With Quarto: Execute Python code cells directly in .qmd files - Automates rendering: Script runs, part generated, image embedded - Documentation never out of sync with code - Single Source of Truth: CAD code and docs in same ecosystem\n2. Professional PDF Assembly Guides - MkDocs: Web-first, PDF generation is afterthought, looks “website-y” - Quarto: LaTeX (or Typst) creates professional textbook-quality PDFs - Automatic page numbering, table of contents, high-resolution diagrams - Single Source: Same .qmd file generates both HTML and PDF - Printable Manual: Users get professional assembly guide in print or PDF\n3. Deep Cross-Referencing - Common Need: “Refer to the bolt shown in Figure 4.2” - MkDocs: Manual figure management, breaks if figures added/removed - Quarto: @fig-bolt-assembly auto-references, renumbers automatically - Automatic equation numbering, table numbering, section references - Adds/removing content doesn’t break cross-references\n4. Conditional Content - Configuration-Aware Docs: Show/hide sections based on user’s config.py - Example: “If printer_type == 'XL', include ‘Large Bed Leveling’ section” - Tier-Specific Content: Show/hide based on Tier 1/2/3 selections - Material-Specific: Show different fastener lists based on rod type - Single Master Doc: One file adapts to all user configurations\n5. Native Code Execution - Live Python: Execute build123d cells during doc render - Data Visualization: Use matplotlib, plotly for diagrams - Math Rendering: Native LaTeX/Typst for equations - Dynamic Content: Generate tables, BOMs, cut lists from config data - Automated Testing: Validate code snippets during doc build\n\n\n\nPlain Markdown - No Code Execution: Cannot run build123d or Python snippets - Manual Screenshots: CAD renders must be manually captured and linked - Sync Issues: Documentation can drift from code changes - Poor PDF: Manual PDF generation, lacks professional formatting - Limited Cross-Referencing: Manual figure/section management\nMkDocs with Extensions - Static Content: Code is displayed, not executed - Web-First: PDF generation is weak/afterthought - Manual Cross-References: Plugins provide limited functionality - No Conditional Content: Complex to show/hide sections based on config - Limited Math: Requires plugins for LaTeX support (not native)\nSphinx (Python Docs) - Software-Focused: Designed for Python API documentation - Complex Setup: Heavy configuration for simple docs - PDF Quality: LaTeX output is functional but not professional -

    "text": "Accepted\n\n\n\nThe Amalgam requires decisions on where to mount the mainboard, host (Pi/SKIPR), and power supply unit (PSU). The placement affects:\nVibration Physics: - Electronics and stepper drivers are sensitive to vibration - High-torque Wade extruder and 3xZ motors generate significant vibration - Direct coupling vs isolation affects reliability and signal integrity\nServiceability: - Mainboard maintenance access - PSU replacement - Wire management for repairs\nThermal Management: - TMC2209 drivers generate heat - MOSFETs for heated bed can run hot - Convection airflow vs active cooling\nWeight Distribution: - PSU weight adds to machine mass - Location affects center of gravity - Affects portability\nWith laminated plinth (ADR-011) and modular puck system (ADR-009), multiple mounting options exist.\n\n\n\nWe adopt a three-tier electronics mounting strategy with direct MDF coupling as Reference Spec.\n\n\nOption A: Direct to Laminated Plinth (Reference Spec) - Architecture: Mainboard and PSU bolted directly to laminated MDF plinth - Vibration Strategy: Direct coupling to vibration sink (MDF CLD kills frame vibration) - Weight: PSU adds to plinth mass (lowers center of gravity) - Thermal: Open bottom square, natural convection + optional quiet fan - Cost: $0 (uses MDF plinth from ADR-011) - Best For: Tier 3 Reference Spec builds\nOption B: Printed “Brain Puck” Frame (Alternative) - Architecture: 3D-printed puck/frame holds mainboard and PSU - Vibration Strategy: Lightweight plastic, couples to workspace surface - Weight: Self-contained, portable - Thermal: Enclosed or honeycomb design, may require active cooling - Cost: Low (~$5-10 AUD in filament) - Best For: Tier 1-2 builds without plinth, portable maintenance\nOption C: Hybrid - Printed Puck to MDF (Tier 3 Enhancement) - Architecture: Printed “Brain Puck” screwed into laminated MDF plinth - Vibration Strategy: MDF plinth provides damping, puck provides modularity - Weight: Puck + PSU contribute to plinth mass - Thermal: Open design with MDF backing for heat sink - Cost: Low (~$5-10 AUD in filament) - Best For: Tier 3 with modular electronics upgrades\n\n\n\nDirect Coupling to MDF (Reference): - Frame bolted directly to plinth (no rubber between) - MDF acts as massive vibration sink - Constrained Layer Damping (ADR-011) converts vibration to heat - Electronics experience minimal transmitted vibration - Recommendation: Direct coupling preferred for “Tractor” reliability\nBolting Through Rubber (Isolation): - Rubber pads between frame and MDF, bolts through to plinth - Creates tuned mass damper - Can reduce high-frequency transmission - Trade-off: Reduces coupling, may allow slight frame movement - Recommendation: Use rubber pads under plinth, not between frame and plinth\nIsolation Under Plinth: - 4x rubber feet under MDF plinth corners - Isolates entire 20kg+ machine from desk - Prevents desk from becoming sounding board - Recommendation: Mandatory for all tiers with plinth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nDirect to MDF (Reference)\nPrinted Brain Puck (Alternative)\n\n\n\n\nVibration Damping\nSuperior (MDF mass)\nPoor (light plastic)\n\n\nMaintenance\nPermanent (harder to remove)\nExcellent (modular)\n\n\nCost\nMinimal (screws)\nLow (filament)\n\n\nAirflow\nOpen, natural convection\nRestricted if enclosed\n\n\nPortability\nLow (part of plinth)\nHigh (standalone)\n\n\nServiceability\nModerate\nExcellent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositioning: - Bottom Rear Corner: Standard placement, balances weight distribution - Bottom Front Corner: Easier access, but may affect Z-homing - On MDF Plinth: Recommended (adds mass, stable) - In Brain Puck: Only for puck-frame builds\nWiring Considerations: - High-Current Wires (heated bed): Use thick gauge (14-16 AWG) to prevent voltage drop - Low-Current Wires (signal): Keep away from high-voltage wiring to prevent EMI - Cable Chains: Required for X/Y axis loom to prevent snagging on moving bed - Wire Length: Keep as short as possible within safety margins\nThermal Management: - PSU Ventilation: Ensure airflow, don’t enclose - TMC Drivers: Can overheat at high currents, add slow quiet fan if needed - MOSFETs: May need heatsinks or active cooling for high-current beds\n\n\n\nVoltage Drop Mitigation: - Heated bed draws highest current (10-15A) - Use 14 AWG or 16 AWG wire for bed power - Keep bed power wires short and direct - Monitor for overheating wires (should not feel hot)\nEMI Protection: - Keep endstop and probe wires away from motor/bed power wires - Use twisted pairs for signal wires - Shield long signal cables - Separate high-current and low-current wiring in cable chains\nCable Chain Routing: - X/Y axis loom from mainboard to gantry - Separate: motors (power), endstops (signal), probe (signal) - Use cable chain or umbilical (bundle held by filament) - Prevent snagging on moving bed components\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiered Flexibility: Direct MDF (Reference), Printed Puck (Alternative), Hybrid (Best of both)\nVibration Optimization: Direct coupling to CLD plinth provides industrial-grade damping\nModularity: Printed puck enables easy mainboard upgrades without unbolting frame\nServiceability: Multiple options from permanent (Reference) to modular (Puck)\nThermal Management: Open designs provide natural convection, fan options available\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect to MDF: Permanent, harder to remove for mainboard replacement\nPrinted Puck: Poor vibration damping (lightweight plastic)\nHybrid: Adds filament cost, but provides modularity + damping\n\n\n\n\n\nTier 3 Reference: Direct MDF mounting for maximum damping\nTier 1-2 Alternative: Printed puck builds without plinth\nAll Tiers: Proper wire management (voltage drop, EMI protection)\nFuture Upgrades: Modular puck allows mainboard swaps\n\n\n\n\n\nMainboard mounting to M12 frame (transmits vibration)\nPSU mounting to moving gantry (adds mass to moving parts)\nUncontrolled wire runs (voltage drop, EMI issues)\nEnclosed electronics boxes (poor thermal management)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParts needed:\n\nMDF plinth (already in ADR-011)\n4x Rubber feet for plinth (vibration isolation)\nMounting screws for mainboard and PSU\nOptional: Slow quiet 120mm fan for electronics cooling\n\nCost implication: Very Low (~$10-15 AUD for feet + screws)\nVibration Damping: Superior (MDF mass)\nMaintenance: Moderate (permanently mounted)\nThermal Management: Open, natural convection\n\n\n\n\n\nParts needed:\n\n3D-printed “Brain Puck” frame/enclosure\nMounting hardware (standoffs, screws)\nOptional: 4x Rubber feet for puck\n\nCost implication: Very Low (~$5-10 AUD in filament)\nVibration Damping: Poor (lightweight plastic)\nMaintenance: Excellent (modular, portable)\nThermal Management: May require active cooling fan\n\n\n\n\n\nParts needed:\n\n3D-printed “Brain Puck” with mounting holes\nWood screws to secure puck to MDF\nMDF plinth (already in ADR-011)\n4x Rubber feet for plinth\n\nCost implication: Very Low (~$5-10 AUD in filament)\nVibration Damping: Superior (MDF mass)\nMaintenance: Excellent (puck can be unscrewed for upgrades)\nThermal Management: Open with MDF backing (heat sink)\n\n\n\n\n\nPSU: 12V or 24V (sufficient current: 20A for 12V, 12A for 24V)\nWiring:\n\n14-16 AWG for heated bed\n18-20 AWG for hotend/fans\n22-24 AWG for signals\nShielded cables for long signal runs\n\nCable Management: Cable chains or umbilicals for X/Y loom\nEMI Protection: Separate high-current and low-current wiring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMainboard Mounting: - Use M3 or M4 standoffs (height ~10mm) - Secure to MDF with wood screws - Ensure flat mounting surface (no warping) - Leave clearance for connectors on all sides\nPSU Mounting: - Bottom rear corner of plinth - Use 4x M4 or M5 bolts through PSU mounting holes - Secure to MDF with large fender washers - Ensure ventilation holes are not blocked - Leave space for wiring access\nWiring Layout:\nBottom Square Layout:\n┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n│          [MDF Plinth]             │\n│  ┌─────┐    ┌──────────────┐    │\n│  │PSU  │    │  Mainboard    │    │\n│  └─────┘    │  (SKIPR/Manta)│    │\n│              └──────────────┘    │\n│         [Cable Chain to Gantry]    │\n└─────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n\n\nPuck Frame Specifications: - Fits within bottom M12 square - Holds mainboard + PSU (if compact) - Honeycomb or perforated sides for airflow - Mounting holes for MDF attachment (if hybrid) - Cable management loops for wire routing\nMounting to Puck: - Mainboard on standoffs (10mm height) - PSU either on puck or next to puck - Leave access for connectors and fan mounting - Wire management channels to prevent tangling\nHybrid Puck to MDF: - Puck screwed into MDF with 4x wood screws - Puck provides modularity, MDF provides damping - Remove puck for mainboard upgrades without unbolting frame\n\n\n\nVoltage Drop Calculation:\nV_drop = I × R × L\nI = Current (heated bed ~12A)\nR = Resistance per meter (14 AWG: 0.0083 Ω/m)\nL = Length in meters (keep &lt;2m if possible)\n\nExample: 12A × 0.0083 × 1.5m = 0.15V drop (acceptable)\nEMI Protection: - Separate power and signal wires by at least 20mm - Use twisted pairs for signal wires - Shield long signal cables (connect shield to ground at one end) - Keep motor wires away from endstop/probe wires\nCable Chain Routing: - Bundle X/Y axis wires (motors + endstops + probe) - Use cable chain from mainboard to X/Y gantry - Prevent snagging on moving bed or Z-rods - Leave slack for full travel range\n\n\n\nTMC Driver Cooling: - Check driver temperature with Klipper: DUMP_TMC STEPPER=stepper_x - Add slow quiet 120mm fan if drivers &gt; 60°C - Point airflow across heatsinks, not directly at components\nPSU Ventilation: - Ensure ventilation holes are not obstructed -

    "text": "Accepted\n\n\n\nThe Amalgam requires a Z-probe for homing and bed-leveling. The choice depends heavily on the bed surface material:\nTwo Probe Technologies: 1. BLTouch: Physical Hall Effect probe with moving pin that touches bed 2. SuperPINDA: Inductive proximity sensor that detects metal without contact\nBed Surface Constraints: - Inductive Probes: Only work on conductive metal (magnetic spring steel sheets like MK52) - Physical Probes: Work on any surface (glass, spring steel, wood, carbon fiber, plain aluminum)\nEngineering Philosophy: - “Tractor” Goal: Set-and-forget reliability with minimal maintenance - “Scavenger” Goal: Universal compatibility with repurposed beds\nThis creates a decision matrix based on both bed surface and reliability requirements.\n\n\n\nWe adopt a bed-surface-dependent probe strategy with SuperPINDA as Reference Spec and BLTouch as Scavenger Fallback.\n\n\nOption A: SuperPINDA (Reference Spec) - Technology: Inductive proximity sensor (solid-state) - Bed Requirement: Magnetic spring steel sheet (MK52 or compatible) - Mounting: Fixed position on X-carriage or gantry - Wiring: 3 wires (VCC, Ground, Signal) - Reliability: Maximum - no moving parts, resin-encased, nearly indestructible - Cost: ~$30-40 AUD - Best For: Tier 3 Reference Spec builds with MK52 bed\nOption B: BLTouch V3.1 (Scavenger Fallback) - Technology: Physical Hall Effect probe with deployable pin - Bed Requirement: Any surface (glass, carbon fiber, aluminum, spring steel) - Mounting: Fixed position on X-carriage or gantry - Wiring: 5 wires (VCC, Ground, Signal, Control Servo) - Reliability: Moderate - moving pin can snap or bend if it hits print/clip - Cost: ~$50-60 AUD (authentic), ~$15-25 AUD (3DTouch clone) - Best For: Tier 1-2 builds with scavenged beds (glass, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nSuperPINDA (Inductive)\nBLTouch (Physical)\n\n\n\n\nBed Surface\nMetal only (conductive)\nUniversal (any material)\n\n\nAccuracy\nExtremely high, repeatable\nExtremely high, but can drift if pin bent\n\n\nRobustness\nMaximum (solid-state, no moving parts)\nModerate (pin can snap/bend)\n\n\nComplexity\nSimple (3 wires, always-on)\nModerate (5 wires, deploy/retract logic)\n\n\nWear Items\nNone\nPin, springs, servo\n\n\nThermal Drift\nMinimal (modern SuperPINDA)\nNone (mechanical contact)\n\n\nCalibration\nZ-offset once\nZ-offset once, pin deployment verification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Solid-State Reliability - Zero moving parts to fail - Immune to “pin-snag” failures during high-speed travel - Resin-encased design is nearly indestructible - No deployment mechanism to jam or misfire\n2. Thermal Stability - Older inductive probes drifted with bed temperature - PINDA V2 added thermistor to compensate (0.02mm adjustments) - SuperPINDA uses higher-quality components that don’t drift - Trigger height identical at 20°C or 60°C chamber temperature\n3. “Set-and-Forget” Philosophy - Once calibrated, requires no ongoing maintenance - No pin to straighten or replace - No servo mechanism to lubricate or adjust - Perfect for 1000+ day maintenance intervals\n4. Simplicity - 3-wire connection (vs 5 wires for BLTouch) - No deployment/retract logic in Klipper - Always-on proximity sensing - Lower failure surface area\n\n\n\n1.

    "text": "Accepted\n\n\n\nThe Amalgam requires 7 stepper drivers (X, Y1, Y2, E, Z1, Z2, Z3) for the dual-Y gantry and Triple-Z kinematic leveling. The heavy XY gantry (dual 8mm rods, see ADR-021) benefits from dual Y motors driving from both sides. In 2026, the 3D printing electronics ecosystem offers three distinct approaches:\n\nSalvaged Legacy Boards: 4-driver boards from donor printers (Ender 3, Anet A8, i3 Mega)\nModular Modern Boards: 5-8 driver boards requiring separate host (FYSETC Spider, BTT SKR 3)\nIntegrated All-in-One Boards: Boards with built-in Linux host (MKS SKIPR, BTT Manta M8P)\n\nEach path has trade-offs in cost, complexity, and reliability. The decision impacts: - BOM cost ($0 - $100+ AUD) - Wiring complexity (USB cabling, power supplies) - Future expandability (ERCF, multi-color, toolhead modules) - Maintenance (single vs multiple boards to debug)\n\n\n\nWe adopt a three-tier architecture with the MKS SKIPR as the Tier 3 Reference Spec mainboard.\n\n\nHardware: Single salvaged 4-driver board + external host - The Hack: Single Z-motor drives all three lead screws via closed-loop belt - Z-Leveling: Manual leveling once with spacers (no Z-tilt) - Host: Pi Zero 2W or old laptop - Cost: ~$80 AUD total - Trade-off: No automated Z-tilt, belt-driven Z synchronization - Best For: Emergency builds, absolute minimum cost\n\n\n\nHardware: Two salvaged 4-driver boards + external host\nThis is the recommended path for dual-donor builds. Two donor printers provide 8 stepper drivers total—more than enough for Amalgam’s 7 motors.\n\nConfiguration:\n\nBoard A: X, Y1, Z1, E (4 drivers)\nBoard B: Y2, Z2, Z3, spare (4 drivers)\n\nConnection: Both boards via USB to single Klipper host\nHost: Old laptop (free), Pi Zero 2W ($25), or Pi 3B ($50)\nZ-Leveling: Automated Klipper Z-tilt\nCost: ~$100-150 AUD (2× donors @ $50 + host)\nTrade-off: Higher wiring complexity, dual firmware flashing\nBest For: Maximum scavengeability, lowest total cost\n\nWhy dual Y motors (Y1, Y2)? The XY gantry with dual 8mm rods (ADR-021) is heavier than single-rod designs. Driving from both sides eliminates racking forces and improves motion quality. Most donor printers have 4-5 motors, so two donors provide 8-10 motors—plenty for the 7 required.\nSingle Y motor option: If using a lighter gantry or limited motors, a single Y motor works but may exhibit slight racking at high accelerations. This reduces driver requirement to 6, allowing a single 6-driver board (MKS SKIPR) or leaving a spare on Tier 2 dual-board setup.\n\n\n\nHardware: MKS SKIPR all-in-one board - Integrated SOC: Rockchip RK3328 (equivalent to Pi 3) built-in - Driver Capacity: 7 driver slots (7 required, or 6 + 1 spare if single Y motor) - Storage: 8GB/16GB eMMC onboard - CAN Bus: Native port for toolhead modules (MKS THR36/42) - Z-Leveling: Automated Klipper Z-tilt on single MCU - Cost: ~$85 AUD - Trade-off: Cannot upgrade SOC (fixed to RK3328) - Best For: Reference Spec build, maximum reliability\n\n\n\n1. Cost-Performance Ratio - $85 AUD vs ~$130+ AUD for BTT Manta M8P + CB1 module - Includes integrated host (no separate Pi to buy) - 7 drivers covers all requirements with spare slot\n2. Simplicity - One board, one power supply, zero external USB data cables - Single firmware flash - Reduces wiring complexity (common failure point in DIY builds)\n3. CAN Bus Synergy - Native CAN port compatible with toolhead modules - Future-proof for ERCF v2, toolhead sensors - Eliminates need for separate CAN adapters\n4.

The heavy XY gantry (dual 8mm rods, see ADR-021) benefits from dual Y motors driving from both sides. In 2026, the 3D printing electronics ecosystem offers three distinct approaches:\n\nSalvaged Legacy Boards: 4-driver boards from donor printers (Ender 3, Anet A8, i3 Mega)\nModular Modern Boards: 5-8 driver boards requiring separate host (FYSETC Spider, BTT SKR 3)\nIntegrated All-in-One Boards: Boards with built-in Linux host (MKS SKIPR, BTT Manta M8P)\n\nEach path has trade-offs in cost, complexity, and reliability.

    "text": "We adopt a three-tier architecture with the MKS SKIPR as the Tier 3 Reference Spec mainboard.\n\n\nHardware: Single salvaged 4-driver board + external host - The Hack: Single Z-motor drives all three lead screws via closed-loop belt - Z-Leveling: Manual leveling once with spacers (no Z-tilt) - Host: Pi Zero 2W or old laptop - Cost: ~$80 AUD total - Trade-off: No automated Z-tilt, belt-driven Z synchronization - Best For: Emergency builds, absolute minimum cost\n\n\n\nHardware: Two salvaged 4-driver boards + external host\nThis is the recommended path for dual-donor builds. Two donor printers provide 8 stepper drivers total—more than enough for Amalgam’s 7 motors.\n\nConfiguration:\n\nBoard A: X, Y1, Z1, E (4 drivers)\nBoard B: Y2, Z2, Z3, spare (4 drivers)\n\nConnection: Both boards via USB to single Klipper host\nHost: Old laptop (free), Pi Zero 2W ($25), or Pi 3B ($50)\nZ-Leveling: Automated Klipper Z-tilt\nCost: ~$100-150 AUD (2× donors @ $50 + host)\nTrade-off: Higher wiring complexity, dual firmware flashing\nBest For: Maximum scavengeability, lowest total cost\n\nWhy dual Y motors (Y1, Y2)? The XY gantry with dual 8mm rods (ADR-021) is heavier than single-rod designs. Driving from both sides eliminates racking forces and improves motion quality. Most donor printers have 4-5 motors, so two donors provide 8-10 motors—plenty for the 7 required.\nSingle Y motor option: If using a lighter gantry or limited motors, a single Y motor works but may exhibit slight racking at high accelerations. This reduces driver requirement to 6, allowing a single 6-driver board (MKS SKIPR) or leaving a spare on Tier 2 dual-board setup.\n\n\n\nHardware: MKS SKIPR all-in-one board - Integrated SOC: Rockchip RK3328 (equivalent to Pi 3) built-in - Driver Capacity: 7 driver slots (7 required, or 6 + 1 spare if single Y motor) - Storage: 8GB/16GB eMMC onboard - CAN Bus: Native port for toolhead modules (MKS THR36/42) - Z-Leveling: Automated Klipper Z-tilt on single MCU - Cost: ~$85 AUD - Trade-off: Cannot upgrade SOC (fixed to RK3328) - Best For: Reference Spec build, maximum reliability\n\n\n\n1. Cost-Performance Ratio - $85 AUD vs ~$130+ AUD for BTT Manta M8P + CB1 module - Includes integrated host (no separate Pi to buy) - 7 drivers covers all requirements with spare slot\n2. Simplicity - One board, one power supply, zero external USB data cables - Single firmware flash - Reduces wiring complexity (common failure point in DIY builds)\n3. CAN Bus Synergy - Native CAN port compatible with toolhead modules - Future-proof for ERCF v2, toolhead sensors - Eliminates need for separate CAN adapters\n4.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Accepted\n\n\n\nThe hotend is the “lungs” of a 3D printer, melting and extruding filament with precision. In 2026, there are multiple hotend options: - Standard hotends (E3D V6, Dragon, Mosquito) - High-flow hotends (Volcano, Dragon HF, Rapido) - Budget hotends (MK8, generic clones) - Direct drive integrated hotends\nModern printers often use high-flow hotends for fast printing (200mm/s+). However, larger melt zones cause “oozing” and require complex tuning. Budget hotends are cheap but suffer from heat creep and inconsistent flow.\nThe Amalgam’s philosophy is “Precision over Ooze” - we prioritize reliability and dimensional accuracy over raw volumetric flow.\n\n\n\nWe choose E3D V6 (or high-quality clone) with CHT (Core Heating Technology) Nozzle as the reference hotend system.\n\n\n\nProven reliability: 10+ years of community testing and refinement\nHeat creep resistance: Compact melt zone prevents filament softening upstream\nDetail precision: Superior control for fine details and rapid tool-changes\nERCf compatible: Short melt zone essential for clean color swaps\nLow mass: Maintains Z-height without adding weight to toolhead\nWidely available: Huge ecosystem of clones, parts, and upgrades\nRepairable: Individual parts (nozzle, heater block, heatbreak) replaceable\n\n\n\n\nCHT (Core Heating Technology) is a “Neo” flow hack that bridges the gap between standard and high-flow hotends.\nWhat is CHT? - Nozzle with internal “three-way” splitter - Melts filament from inside out (vs outside in) - Increases flow by up to 50% without larger melt zone\nWhy CHT? - No ooze penalty: Melt zone remains V6-sized (no “Volcano” strings) - 50% more flow: Enables 120mm/s speeds with Wade extruder - Better layer bonding: Improved thermal transfer - Cost-effective: ~$5-8 AUD per nozzle - Reversible: Swap back to standard nozzle any time\n\n\n\n\nHotend: TriangleLab or Mellow E3D V6 Clone (All-Metal for ERCF)\nNozzle Set:\n\n1x 0.4mm Standard Brass (multi-color detail)\n1x 0.6mm Standard Brass (structural parts)\n1x 0.4mm CHT Clone (high-speed tuning)\n\nHeater: 40W cartridge heater (or 24V clone)\nThermistor: 100K NTC 3950 (standard)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimal oozing: Short melt zone prevents sagging and blobs\nExcellent detail: 0.1mm layers with high precision\nERCf compatibility: Essential for clean multi-color transitions\nMass balance: Not too heavy for Wade extruder torque\nSoftware simplicity: No complex retraction tuning required\nFlow flexibility: CHT enables speed when needed\n\n\n\n\n\nFlow limited (without CHT): Standard V6 flow ~15mm³/s (not 30mm³/s like Volcano)\nNot for racecars: Won’t support 200mm/s+ speeds\nNozzle swaps: Changing flow requires nozzle change\nClone quality: Must buy high-quality clones (avoid garbage)\n\n\n\n\n\nOoze factor: Large melt zone causes stringing and blobs\nRetraction tuning: Complex tuning required for clean retractions\nZ-height impact: Longer block reduces build height\nERCf struggles: Larger melt zone causes color transition issues\nOverkill for 70-120mm/s: Wade + CHT provides sufficient flow\n\n\n\n\n\nCost: Dragon ~$100+, Rapido ~$150+ (vs V6 clone ~$15-25)\nProprietary: Specialized parts not hardware-store available\nComplexity: More complex installation and repair\nOver-engineering: For 70-120mm/s, V6+CHT is sufficient\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParts needed:\n\nE3D V6 All-Metal hotend clone (TriangleLab, Mellow)\nNozzle set: 0.4mm (2x), 0.6mm (1x), CHT 0.4mm (1x)\n40W cartridge heater (24V)\n100K NTC 3950 thermistor\nHeatbreak (if separate)\n\nCost implication: Medium (~$25-35 AUD)\nDonor compatibility: All donors (replaces donor hotend)\nERCf compatibility: Required All-Metal version\nNote: Buy from reputable sellers (TriangleLab, Mellow)\n\n\n\n\n\nParts A: Donor has All-Metal V6 or clone\n\nParts needed: Salvage hotend assembly\nMay need: New nozzles (0.4mm, 0.6mm, CHT)\nMay need: New thermistor (pottable)\nCost implication: Very Low (~$10-15 AUD for nozzles)\nDonor compatibility: Prusa MK2/3, Anet A8, Prusa i3\nNote: Verify thermistor type matches Klipper config\n\nParts B: Donor has PTFE hotend (Ender 3, CR-10)\n\nParts needed: MUST BUY V6 All-Metal hotend\nPTFE hotends cannot do multi-color (clogs with repeated loading)\nCost implication: Medium (~$25-35 AUD)\nDonor compatibility: Ender 3, CR-10, V-Core\nNote: ERCf requires All-Metal (no PTFE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParts needed: MUST BUY V6 All-Metal hotend\nReason: MK8 has poor thermal performance, heat creep issues\nCost implication: Medium (~$25-35 AUD)\nDonor compatibility: Most budget printers\nNote: Donor hotend unsuitable for precision or multi-color\n\n\n\n\n\nParts needed: Buy new (hotends rarely found in non-printers)\nException: Maybe find in junked 3D printers at e-waste\nCost implication: Medium if buying new\nNote: Scavenged hotends often have worn nozzles or cracked heatbreaks\n\n\n\n\n\nParts needed:\n\nDragon or Rapido hotend\nCustom adapter puck\n\nCost implication: High (~$100-150 AUD)\nDonor compatibility: N/A (requires new purchase)\nBenefits: 30+mm³/s flow, superior thermal control\nWarning: Violates “hardware store” repair ethos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV6 mounts via GrooveMount pattern (16mm diameter)\nStandard “Extruder Puck” provides GrooveMount interface\nCompatible with Wade extruder and other toolheads\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy: Potted thermistor provides permanent thermal contact\nHow: Use High-Temp Red RTV Silicone\nProcess: Insert thermistor, fill void with RTV, cure 24hrs\nBenefit: No tape failures, no thermal drift\nDonor note: Scavenged thermistors must be re-potted\n\n\n\n\nStandard Brass 0.4mm: High detail, moderate flow (~15mm³/s)\nStandard Brass 0.6mm: Structural parts, faster printing (~20mm³/s)\nCHT 0.4mm:           High-speed, 50% more flow (~22mm³/s), low ooze\n\n\n\nPLA:   195-210°C (200°C typical)\nPETG:  235-250°C (240°C typical)\nABS:   240-260°C (250°C typical)\nTPU:   215-230°C (220°C typical)\nASA:   245-260°C (250°C typical)\n\n\n\n\n4010 axial fan (standard E3D configuration)\nDuct designed to direct air at part, not nozzle\nDonor fans usually compatible\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirement: All-Metal heatbreak (no PTFE)\nWhy: Repeated filament loading/unloading melts PTFE, causing clogs\nTip: Check heatbreak material before buying (stainless steel or titanium)\n\n\n\n\n\nNozzle replacement: Every ~500-1000 hours (performance degrades)\nHeatbreak inspection: Check for cracks annually\nClean cold pulls: Every ~50 hours of printing\nThermistor check: Verify calibration with hotend thermometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n../manifesto.md: Section “Hotend Flow Optimization”\nE3D

    "title": "ADR-000: Amalgam Engineering Philosophy (20 Years of RepRap Wisdom)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Accepted\n\n\n\nThe Amalgam project stands on the shoulders of two decades of RepRap development (2007-2027). Over this period, the 3D printing community has evolved from experimental open-source innovation to mature engineering practices. This accumulated wisdom has settled on specific engineering truths that balance physical mass, software intelligence, and environmental control.\nMany modern printers chase extreme specifications (600mm/s, linear rails, carbon fiber) at the expense of accessibility, cost, and reliability. The Amalgam aims to distill 20 years of community knowledge into a cohesive engineering philosophy that delivers industrial-quality printing on a hobbyist budget.\n\n\n\nWe adopt the “Rigid Base, Agile Head” philosophy, codified as the Amalgam Engineering Principles:\n\n\n\nMass is a Filter: A heavy, rigid frame dampens high-frequency vibrations and provides structural authority\nSoftware is the Great Equalizer: Klipper features (Input Shaping, Pressure Advance) compensate for hardware limitations\nGearing is Sovereignty: Geared direct drive (Wade/BMG) provides superior extrusion reliability\nThe “Good Enough” Zenith: Performance that exceeds requirements without chasing diminishing returns\n\n\n\n\nWe balance four constraints, not three:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorner\nAmalgam Position\nTrade-off\n\n\n\n\nCost\n&lt;$300 AUD\nWe sacrifice Convenience—more Effort, less money\n\n\nSpeed\n70-120mm/s\nWe “settle” for adequate speed—perfect quality &gt; high-speed failures\n\n\nQuality\nIndustrial-grade\nAchieved through software intelligence, not expensive hardware\n\n\nEffort\nHigh (build) / Low (maintenance)\nOverbuilt hardware requires upfront effort but runs reliably\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-Mass Frame (Tractor): M12 threaded rod skeleton absorbs vibrations, provides stability\nLow-Weight Gantry (Racecar): Lightweight moving parts minimize inertia\nGeared Wade Extruder: Heavy but unstoppable extrusion, prioritized over raw speed\n\n\n\n\n\nPSU: Mount to frame (lowers center of gravity, adds stability)\nFilament Spool: Keep independent (pendulum effect from top-mount ruins surface quality)\nElectronics: Base mount (protect from heat, keep gantry clear)\nFasteners: Unified fastener system (M3 + M12) where possible\n\n\n\n\n\n1.75mm Filament: Standardized for better flow control, thermal efficiency, and detail\nDry Filament Mandate: No longer optional—dryers essential for consistent results\nTriple-Z Kinematic Leveling: Eliminates bed leveling errors rather than compensating\nDraft-Free Enclosure: Critical for engineering materials (ABS, PC, Nylon)\nInput Shaping: Enables heavy frames to perform like lightweight ones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProven Architecture: Every design choice has 20 years of community validation\nPredictable Failures: Well-understood failure modes and solutions\nHigh Reliability: Overbuilt hardware requires minimal maintenance once assembled\nGlobal Accessibility: All components available at local hardware stores\nSoftware-Led Quality: Klipper compensates for hardware limitations, keeping costs low\nScalability: Principles apply across build volumes and donor types\n\n\n\n\n\nHigher Initial Effort: Building a “Tractor” takes more time than assembling an appliance\nHeavy Machine: ~15-20kg total weight—not portable\nModerate Speed: Cannot compete with 300-600mm/s speed demons\nIndustrial Aesthetic: Threaded rods and open structure less “pretty” than enclosed appliances\nSet-and-Forget Philosophy: Requires careful initial setup, but minimal ongoing tinkering\n\n\n\n\n\nADR-001 (M12 Skeleton): Chosen for mass damping and rigidity\nADR-002 (Greg Wade): Chosen for geared extrusion reliability\nADR-003 (Smooth Rods): Low-cost linear motion compatible with heavy frame\nADR-005 (Triple-Z): Kinematic leveling for set-and-forget reliability\nADR-009 (Puck System): Modularity without sacrificing rigidity\n\n\n\n\n\nLightweight aluminum extrusion frames (insufficient mass damping for our cost target)\nLinear rails (unnecessary cost for our speed envelope)\nDirect-drive extruders without gearing (insufficient torque for reliable printing)\nHigh-speed motion chasing (diminishing returns, exponential cost increase)\nMulti-toolhead systems (too complex for &lt;$300 target)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilosophy alignment: Full “Tractor” build with overbuilt hardware\nParts needed:\n\nM12 threaded rods (new or galvanized)\nGreg Wade extruder components\nE3D V6/CHT hotend\nTriple-Z stepper motors\nFilament dryer (essential)\n\nCost implication: Medium ($250-350 AUD total)\nDonor compatibility: All donors (may need to supplement missing parts)\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilosophy alignment: Partial alignment—scavenge where possible, maintain core principles\nParts needed:\n\nScavenged smooth rods/steppers from printer\nNew M12 rods (frame must

    "text": "The Amalgam project stands on the shoulders of two decades of RepRap development (2007-2027). Over this period, the 3D printing community has evolved from experimental open-source innovation to mature engineering practices. This accumulated wisdom has settled on specific engineering truths that balance physical mass, software intelligence, and environmental control.\nMany modern printers chase extreme specifications (600mm/s, linear rails, carbon fiber) at the expense of accessibility, cost, and reliability. The Amalgam aims to distill 20 years of community knowledge into a cohesive engineering philosophy that delivers industrial-quality printing on a hobbyist budget."

Subsequent analysis (ADR-020, ADR-021) demonstrated that dual 8mm rods with shared load achieve equal or better deflection performance while being fully scavengeable from donor printers. ADR-021 now defines the reference specification.\n\n\n\n\nAccepted\n\n\n\nLinear motion is critical for dimensional accuracy. The linear guides determine how smoothly the gantry moves and how well the printer maintains position.\nIn 2026, there are multiple linear motion options: - Precision ground smooth rods with linear bearings - Linear rails (MGN9, MGN12, MGN15) - V-slot rollers on aluminum extrusion - Open builds with printed bearings\nModern printers often use linear rails for high-speed operation and minimal maintenance. Budget printers (Ender 3) use V-slot rollers for low cost.

    "text": "Accepted\n\n\n\nThe Amalgam has multiple electrical components that need to communicate: - Main board (motion control) - Toolhead (extruder, hotend, fan) - Z-probe (BLTouch/PINDA) - Future expansions (ERCF, toolhead boards, bed heater, etc.)\nIn 2026, there are two main communication architectures: - Traditional wiring: Every component wired directly to main board with individual cables - CAN bus: Network-based communication with shared twisted-pair wiring\nTraditional 3D printers use direct wiring, but high-end systems (Voron 2.4, toolhead boards) use CAN bus for reduced wiring and improved reliability.\n\n\n\nWe choose CAN bus support as an optional upgrade path for Amalgam, with traditional wiring as the baseline.\n\n\n\nTier 1-2: Traditional Wiring

    "text": "Accepted\n\n\n\nThe Amalgam is a heavy machine: - M12 iron skeleton: ~15kg - 3x Z-motors + geared extruder: ~3kg - Total build weight: ~18-20kg\nA “Naked Frame” (frame sitting directly on workspace) has limitations: 1. Vibration Transmission: Frame acts as speaker for motor noise 2. Portability Issues: Picking up frame can flex/twist it 3. High-Frequency Resonance: Can cause ringing/ghosting 4. Floor Interaction: Uneven surfaces affect frame squareness\nAt the same time, a well-grounded mass is an engineering advantage—mass damps vibration. The question is how to anchor that mass properly.\n\n\n\nWe adopt a Laminated Plinth Baseboard as the Tier 3 Reference Spec foundation, using Constrained Layer Damping (CLD) to convert motor vibrations into microscopic heat.\n\n\nThe Plinth: Two 18mm MDF boards (36mm total thickness) glued together with viscoelastic adhesive.\nConstruction:\n┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n│   Top MDF Board (18mm)              │\n│   ↓                                 │\n│   Viscoelastic Glue Layer (CLD)     │ ← Converts vibration to heat\n│   ↓                                 │\n│   Bottom MDF Board (18mm)           │\n│   ↓                                 │\n│   Rubber Feet (4x corners)          │\n└─────────────────────────────────────┘\nFrame Attachment: - M12 rods pass through drilled holes in plinth - Secured with large fender washers + M12 nuts on underside - Frame bolts down to plinth (through-bolted) - Z-pucks either clamped to rods (Naked) or screwed to MDF (Tier 3)\n\n\n\n1. Constrained Layer Damping (CLD) - When motors vibrate, they send sound waves through plinth - Glue layer is stretched/compressed (shear strain) - Mechanical friction in glue converts kinetic energy to heat - Result: Vibration “dies” in glue instead of ringing through frame\n2. Glue Choice Matters - Standard PVA Wood Glue: Dries hard → very stiff but poor damping - Green Glue / Construction Adhesive: Stays slightly rubbery → maximizes energy conversion (acoustically dead) - Viscoelastic: The gold standard for CLD in industrial/audio applications\n3. Massive Inertia - 36mm MDF slab anchored to M12 frame creates ~20kg+ workstation - Provides heavy ballast resisting high-acceleration moves - Machine won’t budge or twist during operation\n4.

    "text": "The Amalgam is a heavy machine: - M12 iron skeleton: ~15kg - 3x Z-motors + geared extruder: ~3kg - Total build weight: ~18-20kg\nA “Naked Frame” (frame sitting directly on workspace) has limitations: 1. Vibration Transmission: Frame acts as speaker for motor noise 2. Portability Issues: Picking up frame can flex/twist it 3. High-Frequency Resonance: Can cause ringing/ghosting 4. Floor Interaction: Uneven surfaces affect frame squareness\nAt the same time, a well-grounded mass is an engineering advantage—mass damps vibration. The question is how to anchor that mass properly."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Accepted\n\n\n\nThe Amalgam requires a motion control strategy that balances reliability, cost, and accuracy. Key considerations:\nDriver Technology: - “Smart” Drivers (TMC2130, TMC2209, TMC2240): UART communication, sensorless homing, silent operation - “Dumb” Drivers (A4988, DRV8825): Fixed step/dir, no communication, no sensorless homing\nEndstop Strategy: - Sensorless Homing: Detects motor stall (requires TMC drivers) - Mechanical Endstops: Physical switches with electrical contact\nZ-Axis Safety: - Moving Bed: Amalgam uses moving bed (bed drops for increased Z) - Bed-Drop Risk: Power loss can cause heavy bed to back-drive lead screws and crash - Homing Logic: BLTouch probes bed from below (Z-min at nozzle)\nSalvaged donor boards often have “dumb” drivers (A4988/DRV8825) fixed to PCB, limiting sensorless options. However, mechanical switches offer superior repeatability and temperature stability.\n\n\n\nWe adopt a TMC2209-first strategy with mechanical endstops for reliability.\n\n\nTier 1: Pure Scavenger (Dumb Drivers) - Hardware: Salvaged board with A4988/DRV8825 drivers - Acceptable For: Triple-Z motors on Multi-MCU setup (Z-motors don’t need sensorless homing) - Limitation: X/Y must use mechanical endstops (no sensorless) - Trade-off: No silent operation, no advanced features\nTier 2: TMC2209 (Recommended) - Hardware: TMC2209 drivers (SKR Pico, BTT boards, or modular) - UART Mode: Full Klipper communication for stealthchop, spreadcycle, current control - Silent Operation: StealthChop at low speeds, SpreadCycle at high speeds - Cost: ~$5-10 AUD per driver - Best For: All axes, all tiers where budget allows\nTier 3: High-End TMC (Optional) - Hardware: TMC2240 or TMC5160 drivers - Features: Higher current, better heat dissipation, more diagnostic data - Cost: ~$15-25 AUD per driver - Trade-off: Overkill for “Tractor” speed envelope - Best For: Voron-style “Racecar” builds\n\n\n\nX & Y Axes: Mechanical Endstops - Hardware: Standard mechanical microswitches (NO contacts preferred) - Position: Physical end-of-travel on X and Y - Why Mechanical Over Sensorless: - Repeatability: Mechanical switches have absolute position (±0.01mm) - Temperature Stability: No thermal drift (TMC stall detection temperature-sensitive) - Reliability: Works regardless of driver technology or wear - Cost: ~$2-5 AUD per switch - For TMC Builds: Can use sensorless, but mechanical recommended for “Tractor” reliability - For “Dumb” Driver Builds: Required (no alternative)\nZ-Axis: BLTouch Virtual Endstop - Hardware: BLTouch V3.1 or compatible probe - Position: Nozzle tip acts as Z-min - How It Works: - Bed moves up toward nozzle - BLTouch pin deploys, contacts bed - Klipper triggers Z-min interrupt - Z-tilt calibration uses BLTouch data - Why BLTouch: - Probing: Essential for Z-tilt (three-point bed calibration) - Mesh Bed Leveling: Optional advanced leveling - Reliability: Well-tested, community-supported - Configuration: ```ini [bltouch] sensor_pin: PB1 control_pin: PB0\n[safe_z_home] home_xy_position: 150,150 speed: 50 z_hop: 10 ```\nZ-Axis Safety: Z-Max Physical Endstop - Hardware: Mechanical microswitch at bottom of M12 frame - Position: Absolute physical limit (bed cannot go lower) - Purpose: Prevent “bed-drop” crash during power loss - How It Works: - Gravity can back-drive lead screws when motors lose power - Heavy bed (~3-5kg) can crash into plinth/electronics - Z-max switch provides hardware interrupt to stop motion - Wiring: Connect to Z-max pin on mainboard - Configuration: ```ini [stepper_z] endstop_pin: probe:z_virtual_endstop position_min: -2 position_max: 250\n[gcode_button z_max_safety] pin: PA2 press_on_gcode: TURN_OFF_HEATERS ; Safety logic ``` - Klipper Implementation: - Z-max switch can trigger emergency stop (M112) - Or pause print and turn off heaters\n\n\n\nOption A: SKR Pico (4x TMC2209) - Cost: ~$35 AUD - Drivers: 4 integrated TMC2209 (no soldering required) - Use Case: Supplement salvaged board in Tier 2 Multi-MCU setup - Pinout: Well-documented for Klipper\nOption B: Modular TMC Sticks - Hardware: TMC2209 plug-in modules for boards like RAMPS - Cost: ~$5-10 AUD per driver - Trade-off: Requires wiring UART pins with jumper wires - Use Case: Upgrading salvaged boards with soldered A4988 drivers\nOption C: Built-in TMC (Modern Boards) - Hardware: FYSETC Spider, BTT SKR 3, MKS SKIPR -

    "text": "The Amalgam requires a motion control strategy that balances reliability, cost, and accuracy. Key considerations:\nDriver Technology: - “Smart” Drivers (TMC2130, TMC2209, TMC2240): UART communication, sensorless homing, silent operation - “Dumb” Drivers (A4988, DRV8825): Fixed step/dir, no communication, no sensorless homing\nEndstop Strategy: - Sensorless Homing: Detects motor stall (requires TMC drivers) - Mechanical Endstops: Physical switches with electrical contact\nZ-Axis Safety: - Moving Bed: Amalgam uses moving bed (bed drops for increased Z) - Bed-Drop Risk: Power loss can cause heavy bed to back-drive lead screws and crash - Homing Logic: BLTouch probes bed from below (Z-min at nozzle)\nSalvaged donor boards often have “dumb” drivers (A4988/DRV8825) fixed to PCB, limiting sensorless options. However, mechanical switches offer superior repeatability and temperature stability."

    "text": "Accepted\n\n\n\nThe Amalgam requires a decision on multi-material/color capability. Three approaches exist in 2026:\n1. Single Toolhead (Base Spec) - One hotend/extruder - Manual material changes (swap filament manually) - No waste, no complexity - Cost: $0 additional\n2. Filament Swapper (e.g., ERCF v2) - Single hotend, multiple filament inputs - Switches filament behind nozzle - High waste (purge tower), same-material limitation - Cost: ~$150 AUD - Best for: Multi-color PLA prints\n3. Tool-Changer (e.g., Tapchanger, Prusa XL) - Multiple hotends/extruders on automated docking system - Near-zero waste, true multi-material (PLA+TPU+PVA) - Extreme mechanical complexity - Cost: $300-600+ AUD - Best for: Professional multi-material production\nKey Engineering Trade-offs: - Cost: Single → ERCF → Tool-changer (exponential increase) - Complexity: Low → High → Extreme (calibration nightmare) - Waste: None → High → Near-zero - Multi-Material: No → Same-material only → True multi-material\nThe Amalgam’s $300 AUD target and “Tractor” philosophy prioritizes reliability and low cost.\n\n\n\nWe adopt a Single Toolhead Base Spec with ERCF v2 as Official Expansion.\n\n\nArchitecture: One E3D V6/CHT hotend with Greg Wade extruder\nWhy This Fits the “Tractor”: - Cost: $0 additional (already in BOM) - Reliability: One hotend = one point of failure - Simplicity: No calibration, no macro tuning - Maintenance: Standard single-nozzle maintenance only - Speed: No swap time, continuous printing - Best For: Single-color/monochrome prints, prototype iteration\nLimitations: - Manual filament changes required - No multi-material printing (without manual swap) - No nozzle diversity (one nozzle size per print)\n\n\n\nArchitecture: ERCF v2 with Bowden extension to single hotend\nWhy ERCF Over Tool-Changer: - Cost: ~$150 AUD vs $300-600+ for tool-changer - Simplicity: High complexity, but manageable macro tuning - Compatibility: Uses single hotend (no multiple hotend costs) - Materials: Handles 12+ colors in same material (e.g., PLA) - Proven: Well-documented community support\nTrade-offs: - Waste: Requires purge tower (~10-20g waste per swap) - Speed: 30-60s per filament swap - Materials: Limited to same-material family (PLA+PLA, not PLA+TPU) - Tuning: Requires macro calibration for reliable operation\nBest For: Multi-color prints, hobbyist experimentation, color prototypes\n\n\n\nArchitecture: Multiple hotends/extruders with automated docking\nWhy Rejected for Amalgam: - Cost: Violates $300 AUD target immediately - Complexity: Sub-millimeter mechanical offsets required - Calibration: Tool A must be within 0.1mm of Tool B (expert-level tuning) - Failure Points: Docking system, multiple hotends, multiple extruders - Not “Tractor”: Requires constant tweaking, contradicts “set-and-forget” philosophy\nTool-Changer Advantages (for reference): - Near-zero waste (tiny prime tower) - True multi-material (PLA+TPU+PVA in same print) - Nozzle diversity (0.4mm + 0.8mm on same job) - Fast swaps (&lt;10s)\nWhen to Consider Tool-Changer: - Professional multi-material production needs - Budget $600+ AUD beyond base spec - Expert-level calibration skills and patience - Multi-material (not just multi-color) requirements\n\n\n\nWhile automated tool-changing is rejected, the Modular Puck System enables manual tool swaps:\nSupported Pucks: - 3D Printing Puck: Standard hotend + extruder - Laser Engraving Puck: 5W-10W diode laser - Pen Plotting Puck: Sharpie or technical pen holder - Drag Knife Puck: Vinyl/cutting blade\nWorkflow: 1. Print completes 2. Power off machine 3. Unscrew 3D printing puck 4. Install laser/pen puck 5. Power on 6. Run TOOL_OFFSET calibration macro 7. Execute laser/pen job\nBenefits: - CNC-Style Versatility: One machine, multiple purposes - No Docking Complexity: Manual swap eliminates automated failure points - Cost-Effective: Each puck ~$20-50 AUD - Reliability: No automated mechanism to fail\nLimitations: - Not automated (30-second manual swap required) - Power cycle between swaps (safety requirement) - No in-print tool changing (separate jobs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiered Flexibility: Base (single) → Expansion (ERCF) → Advanced (manual pucks)\nCost Alignment: Base spec maintains $300 AUD target\nReliability Priority: Single toolhead = minimal failure points\nFuture-Proof: ERCF adds color without changing core architecture\nCNS-Style Expansion: Manual puck swaps for laser/pen capabilities\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Spec: No multi-color capability (requires manual filament swap)\nERCF: Waste generation (purge tower), same-material limitation\nNo Automated Tool-Changing: True multi-material (PLA+TPU) requires separate machine or expensive upgrade\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Spec: Reliable single-nozzle printing for &lt;$300 AUD\nTier 2 Expansion: ERCF v2 adds 12+ color capability for ~$150 AUD\nTier 3 Expansion: Manual puck swaps for laser/pen/drag knife\nAll Tiers: Focus on reliability and “set-and-forget” philosophy\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-toolhead systems (tool-changers)\nDual-extruder setups (bowden systems)\nAutomated docking systems\nCross-platform multi-material machines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParts needed:\n\n1x E3D V6/CHT hotend (already in BOM)\n1x Greg Wade extruder (already in BOM)\n1x Toolhead puck (already in ADR-009)\n\nCost implication: $0 (included in base spec)\nCapability: Single-color/monochrome printing\nMaintenance: Standard hotend/extruder maintenance only\n\n\n\n\n\nParts needed:\n\n1x ERCF v2 kit (gears, selectors, servos)\n1x Servo motor (SG90 or MG90S)\n12x Filament tube holders\n3D-printed ERCF parts (body, gears, mounting)\n1x Bowden extension cable (hotend to ERCF)\n1x CAN bus cable (if using remote CAN board)\n\nCost implication: ~$150 AUD\nCapability: 12+ colors, same-material family\nComplexity: High (macro calibration required)\nPrerequisites: Base spec built, Klipper configured, CAN bus if needed\n\n\n\n\n\nParts needed per puck:\n\n1x Puck base (3D-printed, standard interface from ADR-009)\n1x Device mounting hardware (laser heatsink, pen holder, etc.)\n1x Wiring harness (device-specific)\n\nCost implication: Low (~$20-50 AUD per puck)\nCapability: Laser engraving, pen plotting, drag knife cutting\nComplexity: Low (manual swap, calibration macro)\nPrerequisites: Base spec built, Klipper profiles configured\n\n\n\n\n\nParts needed:\n\n3-4x Complete toolheads (hotend + extruder + nozzle)\n1x Automated docking system (gantry, sensors, actuators)\n1x Kinematic coupling system (ball locks, precision alignment)\nExtra drivers (1-2 per additional toolhead)\nExtended wiring harnesses\n\nCost implication: Very High ($300-600+ AUD)\nCapability: True multi-material (PLA+TPU+PVA), zero waste\nComplexity: Extreme (sub-millimeter calibration, expert-level tuning)\nStatus: Rejected for Amalgam (violates cost/reliability targets)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[extruder]\nstep_pin: PB7\ndir_pin: PB6\nenable_pin: !PA8\nmicrosteps: 16\nrotation_distance: 7.5  # Greg Wade gear ratio\n\n[heater_generic hotend]\npin: PA1\nsensor_type: EPCOS 100K B57560G104F\nsensor_pin: PC2\nmin_temp: 0\nmax_temp: 300\ncontrol: pid\n\n[fan]\npin: PA3\n\n\n\n[extruder]\nstep_pin: PB7\ndir_pin: PB6\nenable_pin: !PA8\nmicrosteps: 16\nrotation_distance: 7.5\n\n# ERCF-specific settings\n[gcode_macro ERCF_SELECT_COLOR]\nvariable_color_index: 0\ngcode:\n  # ERCF macro sequence\n  # 1.

    "text": "The Amalgam requires a decision on multi-material/color capability. Three approaches exist in 2026:\n1. Single Toolhead (Base Spec) - One hotend/extruder - Manual material changes (swap filament manually) - No waste, no complexity - Cost: $0 additional\n2. Filament Swapper (e.g., ERCF v2) - Single hotend, multiple filament inputs - Switches filament behind nozzle - High waste (purge tower), same-material limitation - Cost: ~$150 AUD - Best for: Multi-color PLA prints\n3. Tool-Changer (e.g., Tapchanger, Prusa XL) - Multiple hotends/extruders on automated docking system - Near-zero waste, true multi-material (PLA+TPU+PVA) - Extreme mechanical complexity - Cost: $300-600+ AUD - Best for: Professional multi-material production\nKey Engineering Trade-offs: - Cost: Single → ERCF → Tool-changer (exponential increase) - Complexity: Low → High → Extreme (calibration nightmare) - Waste: None → High → Near-zero - Multi-Material: No → Same-material only → True multi-material\nThe Amalgam’s $300 AUD target and “Tractor” philosophy prioritizes reliability and low cost."

Print completes 2. Power off machine 3. Unscrew 3D printing puck 4. Install laser/pen puck 5. Power on 6. Run TOOL_OFFSET calibration macro 7. Execute laser/pen job\nBenefits: - CNC-Style Versatility: One machine, multiple purposes - No Docking Complexity: Manual swap eliminates automated failure points - Cost-Effective: Each puck ~$20-50 AUD - Reliability: No automated mechanism to fail\nLimitations: - Not automated (30-second manual swap required) - Power cycle between swaps (safety requirement) - No in-print tool changing (separate jobs)"

Bed-Slinger (Prusa i3 style) - Bed moves in Y, gantry moves in X, Z lifts gantry or bed - Common in: Prusa MK3, Ender 3, Anet A8 - Characteristic: Bed swings back and forth during printing\n2. Z-Drop / Moving Bed Z (Voron Trident style) - XY gantry at fixed height, bed moves only in Z - Common in: Voron Trident, RatRig V-Core - Characteristic: Bed drops down as layers are printed\n3. Gantry-Rise / Fixed Bed (Voron 2.4 style) - Bed fixed at bottom, entire XY gantry rises in Z - Common in: Voron 2.4, some industrial machines - Characteristic: Gantry climbs upward during printing\n4.

The most common donors in 2026 fall into two categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonor Type\nExamples\nFrame\nMotion\n\n\n\n\nRod-based\nAnet A8, Wanhao i3, Prusa clones\nAcrylic/sheet\n8mm smooth rods + LM8UU\n\n\nV-slot\nEnder 3, CR-10, Voxelab Aquila\n2020/2040 aluminum\nV-slot + POM wheels\n\n\n\nThe original specification (ADR-001 + ADR-021) assumed rod-based donors: - M10 threaded rod frame (buy new, ~$30-45 AUD) - Dual 8mm smooth rods scavenged from donors\n\n\n\nEnder 3 is arguably the most common donor printer in 2026. Under the original spec, an Ender 3 scavenger must: 1. Discard the aluminum extrusions (no use in M10 frame) 2. Buy 8× stainless smooth rods (~$43 AUD) 3. Buy 22× IGUS bearings (~$30 AUD) 4. Total added cost: ~$73-90 AUD\nThis violates the scavenger philosophy: “use what you have.”\n\n\n\nThe MDF base serves two functions: 1. Mass damping — absorbs vibration from the frame 2. Squaring jig — precision assembly reference\nWith MDF as the foundation, the frame type becomes a variable rather than a constant. Whether M10 threaded rods or aluminum extrusions, the MDF provides: - Geometric reference for squaring - Mass to dampen resonance - Consistent Z-axis mounting\nThe M10 + MDF combination is particularly elegant because: - M10 is adequately stiff (not overkill like M12) - MDF compensates for any remaining flexibility - The system is heavy enough to dampen, light enough to move - MDF is the precision reference (no need for machinist skills)\n\n\n\n\nWe adopt a Multi-Frame Architecture with three supported paths, all sharing a common MDF base:\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nSpecification\n\n\n\n\nFrame\nM10 threaded rod skeleton\n\n\nBase\nMDF squaring jig + damping mass\n\n\nMotion\nDual 8mm smooth rods, vertical stacking\n\n\nBearings\nLM8LUU (X), LM8UU (Y/Z)\n\n\nBest donors\nAnet A8, Wanhao i3, Prusa clones\n\n\n\nCharacter: The heritage path. RepRap Darwin tribute with industrial “tractor” aesthetic.\nWhy choose Scaffold: - RepRap heritage (inspired by the original Darwin) - Industrial “tractor” aesthetic — threaded rod is honest, visible engineering - Hardware-store availability - Forces scavenger mindset (rod-based donors) - Differentiated from commercial designs - M10 frame adds mass for vibration damping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nSpecification\n\n\n\n\nFrame\nAluminum extrusion (2020/2040)\n\n\nBase\nMDF squaring jig + damping mass\n\n\nMotion\nV-slot rails + POM wheels\n\n\nBearings\nPOM V-wheels (3-4 per carriage)\n\n\nBest donors\nEnder 3, CR-10, Voxelab Aquila\n\n\n\nCharacter: The zero-waste path. Uses everything from your Ender donors.\nWhy choose Mill: - Ender 3 is the most common donor - Uses ALL scavenged parts (zero waste) - Proven motion system (Ender 5 style) - ~$70-90 cheaper than forcing smooth rods - Cleaner aesthetic than threaded rod\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nSpecification\n\n\n\n\nFrame\nAluminum extrusion (2020/2040)\n\n\nBase\nMDF squaring jig + damping mass\n\n\nMotion\nDual 8mm smooth rods, vertical stacking\n\n\nBearings\nIGUS drylin (recommended) or LM8UU\n\n\nBest donors\nEnder 3 + purchased rods, or mixed donors\n\n\n\nCharacter: The precision upgrade. Best motion quality, still under budget.\nWhy choose Lathe: - Superior motion system — smooth rods + IGUS bushings outperform POM wheels - IGUS is self-lubricating, maintenance-free, quieter than linear bearings - No eccentric nut adjustments, no flat spots developing over time - Combines modern frame (extrusion) with proven motion (smooth rods) - Two Ender 3 donors @ $50-60 each + ~$75 for rods/IGUS = still under $250 AUD - Best choice if you prioritize motion quality over zero-waste\n\n\n\nAll paths share: - MDF base — squaring jig + mass damping - Z-drop architecture — bed moves in Z only (ADR-023) - Triple-Z leveling — three independent Z-motors (ADR-005) - Cartesian X-Y — head on X, gantry on Y (not Core-XY) - Toolhead — Pitan extruder + E3D V6 (ADR-019, ADR-004) - Electronics — Dual-MCU Klipper or MKS SKIPR (ADR-012)\n\n\n\n\nGot one donor? Just add Klipper to it. Amalgam isn’t for you.\nGot two matching donors? Perfect. Pick your frame path: - Two smooth-rod donors (Anet A8, Wanhao, Prusa clones) → Scaffold (buy M10 rods) - Two V-slot donors (Ender 3, CR-10, Aquila) → Mill (zero-waste) or Lathe (buy rods for better motion) - Mixed donors (one extrusion + one smooth-rod) → Lathe (use extrusions + scavenged rods)\nWant to buy new?

    "title": "Amalgam",
    "section": "",
    "text": "After two decades of RepRap development, the “distilled wisdom” of the 3D printing community has moved beyond just the “Amalgam” philosophy. It now focuses on the balance between physical mass, software intelligence, and environmental control.\nHere are the core engineering truths distilled from 20 years of RepRap history:\n\n1. Motion Systems: Bed-Slinger vs. Box Frame vs. CoreXY\nThe evolution of motion systems reflects a shift from Simplicity to Performance.\n\nBed-Slinger (Cartesian): These are the “early heroes” of the hobbyist scene, prized for their low cost and ease of maintenance. Their primary drawback is inertia; rapidly slinging a heavy bed creates vibrations and “ghosting,” especially as parts get taller and heavier.\nBox-Style Cartesian: Often used in professional environments, these provide far better thermal consistency and reliability for engineering materials like ABS or PC.\nCoreXY: Currently the “motion system of choice” for high performance. By keeping motors stationary and minimizing moving mass, it achieves high acceleration and excellent surface accuracy without sacrificing quality. However, CoreXY is less forgiving than Cartesian systems; belt tensioning and frame squareness are critical.\n\nAmalgam uses a Z-drop Cartesian architecture (the bed moves only in Z) with a gantry-mounted toolhead on X-Y. This avoids the bed-slinger’s inertia problem while keeping the simplicity and repairability that a “Tractor” demands.\n\n\n\n2. Filament: 1.75mm vs. 3mm (2.85mm)\nThe industry has effectively standardized on 1.75mm, and for good reason:\n\nFlow Control: 1.75mm filament is easier to melt and requires less force to extrude, allowing for finer flow control and more responsive retractions.\nThermal Efficiency: Because it has a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio than 3mm filament, it heats up more consistently, which is critical for the high-speed printing demanded in 2026.\nDetail: Finer filaments allow for more precise control over the volume of plastic exiting the nozzle, which is essential for high-detail work.\n\n\n\n\n3. The “Dry Filament” Mandate\nIn 2026, drying filament is no longer considered “optional” for high-quality results.\n\nHygroscopy: Most filaments (especially Nylon, TPU, and PETG) are “hygroscopic,” meaning they absorb water from the air.\nMechanical Failure: Moist filament causes steam bubbles to form in the nozzle, leading to popping sounds, “surface fuzz,” and severe drops in layer adhesion (wet Nylon can lose up to 40% of its stiffness).\nDryers are Essential: A dedicated filament dryer ensures consistent results and prevents “blistering” or uneven extrusion that is often misdiagnosed as a printer hardware problem.\n\n\n\n\n4. Triple-Z and Kinematic Leveling\nThe transition from single or dual Z-axes to Triple-Z represents a shift from “correcting” errors to “eliminating” them.\n\nTrue Leveling: A Triple-Z setup uses three independent motors to physically tilt the bed until it is perfectly parallel to the gantry.\nStability: This 3-point system is more precise than cantilevered or dual-Z designs because it provides a stable “tripod” foundation that resists vibrations and lead-screw “wobble”.\nSet-and-Forget: Auto-leveling with Triple-Z provides a “set-and-forget” experience that removes human error from the first-layer equation.\n\n\n\n\n5. The “Software Intelligence” Revolution\nThe greatest jump in the last 20 years hasn’t been just in iron, but in math.\n\nInput Shaping: This software technique cancels out the physical resonances of a frame. It allows a heavy “Tractor” frame to move as precisely as a lightweight racecar by predicting and counter-acting vibrations.\nPressure Advance: This compensates for the “ooze” or elasticity of molten plastic, ensuring that corners are sharp and extrusion is consistent even during rapid speed changes.\n\n\n\n\n6. General “RepRap Wisdom”\n\nMass is a Double-Edged Sword: High-mass frames (like the Amalgam Scaffold’s M10 skeleton) dampen high-frequency ringing but require more torque to move.\nDrafts are the Enemy: Keeping the print area draft-free is essential to minimize warping and delamination, especially for materials like ABS.\nOver-Cooling Kills Strength: Too much fan cooling can destroy inter-layer bonding; sometimes “ugly” prints with less cooling are mechanically stronger.\nFasteners in Plastic: Don’t over-tighten bolts running through printed parts; plastic deforms over time. Use nylon locking nuts or jam nuts to prevent them from backing out due to vibration.\n\nThe engineering consensus after 20 years of RepRap history has settled on a “Rigid Base, Agile Head” philosophy. Your intuition about mass and weight is the foundation of high-performance 3D printing in 2026.\n\n\n1. The “Tractor-Racecar” Motion Balance\nThe ideal setup is a high-mass frame paired with a low-weight gantry.\n\nHigh-Mass Frame: A heavy frame acts as a mechanical “battery” that absorbs and dampens high-frequency vibrations. This provides structural authority, ensuring the machine doesn’t physically shake itself out of alignment during rapid moves.\nLow-Weight Gantry: Every gram you remove from the moving gantry (X and Y axes) reduces inertia. A lightweight toolhead can stop, start, and change direction instantly without “ghosting” or ringing artifacts.\nThe Conflict: High-torque geared extruders like the Pitan are heavier than direct drives. While they provide superior reliability and filament grip, they limit outright speed. This is why the Amalgam is a “Tractor”—it trades the lightning-fast speed of a lightweight carriage for the unstoppable flow and quality of a geared motor.\n\n\n\n\n2. To Mount or Not to Mount? (PSU & Filament)\nDeciding where to bolt your “Vitamins” is a trade-off between Rigidity and Vibration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nMounting Wisdom\nReason\n\n\n\n\nPower Supply (PSU)\nMount to Frame\nAdding the weight of a metal PSU at the bottom of the frame lowers the machine’s center of gravity, making the “Tractor” even more stable.\n\n\nFilament Spool\nKeep Independent\nNever mount filament to the top of the frame. A 1kg spool 40cm in the air creates a “pendulum effect,” inducing oscillations that ruin surface quality. Mount it to a side bracket or a standalone table stand.\n\n\nElectronics\nBase Mount\nKeep mainboards and wiring at the bottom to protect them from heat and keep the gantry clear of “spaghetti” wiring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Multi-Toolhead vs. Multi-Color (The Waste Debate)\nThis is the great debate of 2026. Both systems allow for colors, but their “philosophies” are opposites.\n\nMulti-Toolhead (e.g., Tool-Changer/IDEX):\n\nPrecision: Uses sub-mm kinematic couplings (like steel ball locks) to ensure the head clicks into the exact same spot every time (often within 0.04mm).\nWaste: Near-zero. Since each nozzle has its own color, you don’t need to “purge” the old plastic out.\nComplexity: Very high. Aligning 3 or 4 nozzles so they all hit the exact same Z-height is a major engineering challenge.\n\nMulti-Color (e.g., ERCF / Bambu AMS):\n\nEfficiency: Uses a single nozzle and swaps the filament behind it.\nWaste: High. Every color change requires a “poop” or “purge tower” to clear the old color from the hotend.\nSimplicity: Mechanically much simpler than a tool changer and fits on a standard “Tractor” gantry easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Other “Distilled Wisdom” Gems\n\nThe “Golden Screw” Rule: Never use two different types of screws for the same function. If you can build the whole frame with M3 and M5, do it. It makes your “Vitamin” box simpler to maintain.\nHeat Creep is the Silent Killer: Most jams aren’t caused by the nozzle; they are caused by the cold-end getting too hot and softening the filament before it reaches the heater. Use a high-quality ball-bearing fan on your E3D V6 to prevent this.\nCable Chains vs. Umbilicals: While cable chains look cool, they can cause “hidden” wire fatigue. Many modern high-end builds have returned to the simple “Umbilical” (a bundle of wires held up by a single piece of filament) because it places less stress on the copper over thousands of hours.\n\n\n\nThe Amalgam Square: Speed, Quality, Cost, and Effort\nIn engineering, we often talk about the “Iron Triangle” (Pick two: Fast, Cheap, or Good). But for 3D printing—and specifically for the Amalgam—a triangle is too simple. The project actually balances a Square of Constraints.\nTo build a machine for under $300 AUD that performs like a modern industrial tool, you have to understand how these four corners pull against each other.\nIn the “Tractor” philosophy, we don’t just “pick two”; we strategically sacrifice one to maximize the others.\n\n1. Cost (The $300 AUD Hard Ceiling)\nThis is our primary constraint. To keep costs low, we sacrifice “Convenience.” Instead of buying a $150 pre-assembled toolhead, we print a Pitan extruder from $4-10 of vitamins. We trade money for Effort.\n\n\n2. Speed (The “Racecar” Mirage)\nThis is where most modern printers fail the triangle. Chasing 600mm/s requires expensive linear rails and lightweight carbon fiber—both of which blow the budget.\n\nThe Wisdom: We “settle” for 70–120mm/s. In the 3D printing world, 100mm/s with perfect quality is faster than 300mm/s with a 50% failure rate.\n\n\n\n3. Quality (The Non-Negotiable)\nThanks to Klipper, quality is no longer tied to the price of the hardware.\n\nInput Shaping cancels out the vibrations of our heavy frame.\nPressure Advance manages the flow of our geared Pitan extruder.\nThe Result: We achieve high-end quality on a “junk” budget by using software intelligence to solve analog hardware problems.\n\n\n\n4. Reliability / Effort (The “Tractor” Soul)\nThis is the fourth corner. A machine can be cheap and high-quality, but usually, that means it’s a “tinker-trap” (like a stock Ender 3).\n\nThe Amalgam approach: We use Overbuilt Hardware (heavy frame, geared Pitan, E3D V6). It takes more effort to build (Effort), but once it’s running, it requires almost no maintenance (Reliability).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “Battle-Tested” Wisdom: Why the Triangle Shifts\nIf you look at the last 20 years, the “Golden Ratio” of these trade-offs has shifted:\n\n2007 (Darwin Era): High Cost / Low Speed / Low Quality / Maximum Effort. (Everything was a struggle).\n2014 (i3 Era): Medium Cost / Medium Speed / Medium Quality / Medium Effort. (The birth of the “reliable enough” hobbyist).\n2026 (Amalgam Era): Ultra-Low Cost / Medium Speed / High Quality / High Initial Effort.\n\n\n\nThe Distilled “Pillars of Truth”\nIf you were to sum up the wisdom of those 20 years into the Amalgam “Standard,” it would look like this:\n\nMass is a Filter: A heavy machine is a quiet machine. Mass filters out the “noise” of cheap motors.\nGearing is Sovereignty: Direct drive is good, but Geared Direct Drive is king. The Pitan’s 3:1 gear ratio turns a cheap NEMA17 into a powerful, reliable extruder.\nSoftware is the Great Equalizer: Don’t spend $200 on rails if $0 of code (Klipper) can fix the vibration.\nThe “Good Enough” Zenith: Chasing the last 5% of speed costs 500% more money. The Amalgam lives at the “Zenith”—where performance is high, but the cost is still accessible to anyone with a local hardware store.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The fused deposition modeling (FDM) industry has entered a period of profound structural realignment. For over a decade, the desktop 3D printing market was defined by the tension between the enthusiast’s desire for tinkering and the prosumer’s need for reliability. This landscape was historically dominated by the RepRap movement and its most successful commercial offspring, Prusa Research, which established the “bed-slinger” Cartesian architecture as the global hobbyist standard.1 However, the emergence of vertically integrated manufacturers, most notably Bambu Lab, has fundamentally disrupted the “reliability-speed-quality” triangle that previously forced users to compromise on at least one of these pillars.3 This report analyzes the historical evolution of these technologies, the economic pressures currently facing the maker community—particularly in high-cost regions such as Australia—and the technical feasibility of returning to open-source roots through salvaged hardware designs.\n\n\nThe modern 3D printing era began with a radical vision of self-replicating machines. The RepRap project, initiated by Dr. Adrian Bowyer, sought to democratize manufacturing by creating printers that could print their own components. Early iterations like the Darwin and Mendel utilized threaded metal rods, nuts, and washers sourced from hardware stores to form rigid frames.\nThe Prusa Mendel Iteration 2 (i2), released in November 2011, represented a significant step forward in simplifying the RepRap assembly process. By utilizing M8 threaded rods to form an equilateral triangle on each side, the frame provided a stable platform for its time.7 However, these machines remained temperamental, often leading to a situation where users spent more time printing parts for the printer than functional objects.9\n\n\nThe transition from the Mendel i2 to the Prusa i3 marked the consolidation of the “bed-slinger” design. This era saw the industry-wide shift from 3mm filament to 1.75mm, which allowed for more precise extrusion control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEra\nKey Model\nMechanical Standard\nPrimary Firmware/Control\n\n\n\n\nRepRap Genesis (2008-2012)\nMendel i2\nThreaded Rods (M8), 3mm Filament\nArduino Mega, Sprinter/Marlin\n\n\nI3 Era (2013-2018)\nPrusa i3 MK2/MK3\nAluminum Profile/Plate, 1.75mm\n8-bit ATMega, Marlin\n\n\nCoreXY Rise (2019-2022)\nVoron 2.4, RatRig\nLinear Rails, Enclosed Frames\n32-bit MCU, Klipper\n\n\nIntegrated Era (2023-Present)\nBambu Lab X1/P1\nProprietary CoreXY, AI Sensors\nCustom Linux/ESP32, Proprietary\n\n\n\nDuring this period, the market saw a “race to the bottom” with inexpensive Chinese clones such as the Anet A8 and the original Ender 3. While these machines were “just good enough,” they lacked the safety features and optimized firmware that made the Prusa MK3S+ the “gold standard” for reliability.1\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, Bambu Lab fundamentally altered user expectations for speed and ease of use.3 Their flagship X1 Carbon and the more affordable P1 and A1 series introduced high-speed kinematics and fully integrated software ecosystems as standard features. This success is driven by “usability”; surveys indicate that over 35% of first-time 3D printer users abandon their devices within six months due to calibration or interface frustrations.\nHowever, this shift has come at the cost of a “closed” ecosystem, relying on proprietary parts and cloud-tethered services that raise concerns about long-term repairability.3\n\n\n\nFor makers in regions such as Australia, global pricing is compounded by currency exchange and logistics. A printer marketed at $800 USD often translates to $1,300 to $1,500 AUD, placing it beyond the reach of many hobbyists.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nModel\nRetail Price (AUD)\nEstimated Status\n\n\n\n\nHigh-End Enthusiast\nBambu Lab H2C\n$3,699.00\nPremium Investment 11\n\n\nMid-Range CoreXY\nBambu Lab P2S\n$949.00 - $1,249.00\nProfessional Tool 12\n\n\nEntry-Level Speed\nBambu Lab A1 Mini\n$319.00 - $379.00\nBeginner Gateway 13\n\n\n\nWhile the A1 Mini is aggressively priced at ~$319 AUD, its small build volume (180mm cube) often leads to “buyer’s remorse” for those needing larger functional items.14 Building a high-performance open-source printer like a Voron remains expensive, with kits often exceeding $1,500 AUD.16\n\n\n\n\nTo counter these costs, a return to the “threaded rod” RepRap spirit is technically viable when combined with modern firmware. Amalgam offers multiple frame paths — from M10 threaded rod skeletons (Scaffold) to aluminum extrusion frames (Mill, Lathe) — all achieving high-quality prints with 220×220×220mm build volume for under $300 AUD.\n\n\nThe Scaffold path uses M10 steel rods (10mm diameter) that provide inherent vibration damping — a critical factor for high-speed FDM. A high-mass frame increases the system’s inertia, resisting oscillations from rapid stepper movements. The Mill and Lathe paths achieve similar damping through aluminum extrusion stiffness combined with an MDF base that acts as a mass damper.\n\n\n\nAmalgam requires two donor printers. This isn’t arbitrary — it provides:\n\nSufficient motors: 4-5 steppers per donor, 8-10 total (Amalgam needs 7-8)\nRedundant electronics: Two boards for Klipper dual-MCU, or spare parts\nMotion components: Rods, bearings, belts, pulleys from both donors\nThe bed: 220×220mm heated bed from an Anet A8 or similar donor\n\n\n\n\nAll Amalgam paths use three independent Z-motors for true kinematic leveling. This configuration:\n\nEnsures Precision: Three-point tilt eliminates bed-to-gantry parallelism errors\nEnables Auto-Leveling: Klipper’s Z-tilt calibration runs at every print start\nEliminates Z-Wobble: Independent motors avoid the binding issues of shared-belt systems\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than a tiered “cheap to expensive” approach, Amalgam adapts to what you scavenged:\n\n\n\nYour Donors\nRecommended Path\nExtra Cost Beyond Donors\n\n\n\n\nTwo Anet A8s / Wanhao i3s\nScaffold\n~$70-110 (M10 rods, misc)\n\n\nTwo Ender 3s / CR-10s\nMill\n~$40-65 (misc only, zero waste)\n\n\nMixed donors\nLathe\n~$115-160 (rods + IGUS bearings)\n\n\n\nThe key principle: maximize reuse of existing parts. The Mill path with two Ender 3 donors is nearly zero-waste — even the aluminum extrusions become the frame.\n\n\n\nA central requirement for modernizing the RepRap movement is the transition to fully parametric, code-based design. Build123d is a Python-based framework that allows the entire printer to be resized or adapted to different hardware in seconds.19\nBy defining variables for rod diameter, build volume, and bearing type, the community can “fork” the machine to fit whatever they scavenge. If a user finds different donors than expected, a configuration change regenerates the entire printable BOM.\n\n\n\nThe 3D printing industry in 2026 stands at a crossroads between the “appliance” (Bambu) and the “project” (RepRap).

    "text": "The modern 3D printing era began with a radical vision of self-replicating machines. The RepRap project, initiated by Dr. Adrian Bowyer, sought to democratize manufacturing by creating printers that could print their own components. Early iterations like the Darwin and Mendel utilized threaded metal rods, nuts, and washers sourced from hardware stores to form rigid frames.\nThe Prusa Mendel Iteration 2 (i2), released in November 2011, represented a significant step forward in simplifying the RepRap assembly process. By utilizing M8 threaded rods to form an equilateral triangle on each side, the frame provided a stable platform for its time.7 However, these machines remained temperamental, often leading to a situation where users spent more time printing parts for the printer than functional objects.9\n\n\nThe transition from the Mendel i2 to the Prusa i3 marked the consolidation of the “bed-slinger” design. This era saw the industry-wide shift from 3mm filament to 1.75mm, which allowed for more precise extrusion control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEra\nKey Model\nMechanical Standard\nPrimary Firmware/Control\n\n\n\n\nRepRap Genesis (2008-2012)\nMendel i2\nThreaded Rods (M8), 3mm Filament\nArduino Mega, Sprinter/Marlin\n\n\nI3 Era (2013-2018)\nPrusa i3 MK2/MK3\nAluminum Profile/Plate, 1.75mm\n8-bit ATMega, Marlin\n\n\nCoreXY Rise (2019-2022)\nVoron 2.4, RatRig\nLinear Rails, Enclosed Frames\n32-bit MCU, Klipper\n\n\nIntegrated Era (2023-Present)\nBambu Lab X1/P1\nProprietary CoreXY, AI Sensors\nCustom Linux/ESP32, Proprietary\n\n\n\nDuring this period, the market saw a “race to the bottom” with inexpensive Chinese clones such as the Anet A8 and the original Ender 3.

    "text": "To counter these costs, a return to the “threaded rod” RepRap spirit is technically viable when combined with modern firmware. Amalgam offers multiple frame paths — from M10 threaded rod skeletons (Scaffold) to aluminum extrusion frames (Mill, Lathe) — all achieving high-quality prints with 220×220×220mm build volume for under $300 AUD.\n\n\nThe Scaffold path uses M10 steel rods (10mm diameter) that provide inherent vibration damping — a critical factor for high-speed FDM. A high-mass frame increases the system’s inertia, resisting oscillations from rapid stepper movements. The Mill and Lathe paths achieve similar damping through aluminum extrusion stiffness combined with an MDF base that acts as a mass damper.\n\n\n\nAmalgam requires two donor printers. This isn’t arbitrary — it provides:\n\nSufficient motors: 4-5 steppers per donor, 8-10 total (Amalgam needs 7-8)\nRedundant electronics: Two boards for Klipper dual-MCU, or spare parts\nMotion components: Rods, bearings, belts, pulleys from both donors\nThe bed: 220×220mm heated bed from an Anet A8 or similar donor\n\n\n\n\nAll Amalgam paths use three independent Z-motors for true kinematic leveling. This configuration:\n\nEnsures Precision: Three-point tilt eliminates bed-to-gantry parallelism errors\nEnables Auto-Leveling: Klipper’s Z-tilt calibration runs at every print start\nEliminates Z-Wobble: Independent motors avoid the binding issues of shared-belt systems",

    "text": "✅ Still Relevant: This exploration of the Scaffold (M10 + MDF) frame path remains current. For canonical design decisions, see: - ADR-001: M10 Threaded Rod Skeleton - ADR-025: Multi-Frame Architecture (includes Scaffold as primary path) - ADR-011: Laminated Plinth Baseboard (MDF damping)\nThis deep-dive provides detailed design rationale for why M10 + MDF works well.\n\n\n\n“The Tractor” is a box-frame 3D printer using M10 threaded rods for the frame structure, mounted on a laminated MDF base. This document covers frame construction, squaring strategies, and assembly workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM10 was chosen as the “reference spec” for several reasons:\n\n\n\nFeature\nM8\nM10\nM12\n\n\n\n\nCross-section\n~50 mm²\n~78 mm²\n~113 mm²\n\n\nRigidity\nMinimum viable\nVery High (3× M8)\nOverkill (5× M8)\n\n\nWeight/Meter\n~0.3 kg\n~0.5 kg\n~0.7 kg\n\n\nNut Size (Hex)\n13mm\n17mm\n19mm\n\n\nPrintability\nEasy\nEasy\nCan make brackets bulky\n\n\n\nWhy M10 over M12: - Standard 17mm wrench is universally available - Easier to cut with a hacksaw - Fits in smaller printed brackets - Common in automotive applications (excellent for scavenging) - Still provides massive rigidity for a 235×235×235 build volume\nNote: The design is parametric—users can build in M8 or M12 if desired.\n\n\n\nFor a 235×235mm bed with Triple-Z motors and toolhead clearance:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxis\nCalculation\nRod Length\n\n\n\n\nX (Width)\nBed (235) + Lead Screws/Motors (80) + Clearance (65)\n~450mm\n\n\nY (Depth)\nBed (235) + Y-Carriage Travel (50) + Motor (60)\n~450mm\n\n\nZ (Height)\nBuild Height (280) + Motor/Coupler (70) + Top Bracket (50)\n~500mm\n\n\n\nTip: Buy 1-meter rods and cut them in half (500mm). Extra length isn’t a problem with the offset method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen three rods meet at a corner, they cannot occupy the same space. The Offset Method (used in the original RepRap Darwin) is superior for threaded-rod builds because:\n\nNo precision cuts required - rods can extend past the corner\nInfinite adjustability - brackets slide along the rod\nEasier assembly - no complex hub geometry\nScavenger-friendly - tolerant of imperfect rod lengths\n\n\n\n\nTo prevent confusion, follow a strict Inside/Outside rule:\n\nX-Rods (Left-to-Right): Outermost layer\nY-Rods (Front-to-Back): Middle layer\n\nZ-Rods (Vertical): Innermost layer\n\nThis keeps Z-rods inside the frame, creating an unobstructed path for the bed to move up and down.\n\n\n\nInstead of thin brackets (like the original Mendel), use 50-60mm long sleeves on the corner brackets:\nBenefits: - Forces rod perpendicularity (rod can’t tilt in a long sleeve) - Acts as a permanent squaring jig - Provides massive clamping surface\nThe “Nut Sandwich” Technique: - Place a nut on both sides of every plastic face the rod passes through - Outer nut: Controls the maximum width - Inner nut: Tensioner that locks the bracket against the outer nut - Adjustment: Turn nuts (not the rod) to shift bracket position by fractions of a millimeter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MDF base is mandatory for the Tractor design:\n\nThickness: 18mm minimum, 36mm (2×18mm laminated) preferred\nMaterial: Laminated MDF (white shelving) recommended\nGlue: PVA between raw particle-board faces\n\nWhy laminated MDF is better: - Factory-smooth, moisture-resistant surface for layout lines - Stiffer than raw MDF of equal thickness - The “raw” sides glue together perfectly\n\n\n\n36mm of laminated MDF provides: - Massive vibration dampening - MDF is internally “lossy” - Low center of gravity - prevents swaying during rapid accelerations - Clean Input Shaping - high, clean resonance frequencies for Klipper\n\n\n\nCoat the MDF with PVA glue/water mix or paint to prevent: - Moisture absorption - Warping that could pull the frame out of square\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of squaring a wobbly skeleton of rods in mid-air, use the MDF base as the Master Reference:\n\nThe MDF baseboard is your jig\nYou only measure precisely once (when drawing layout lines)\nThe 3D printed anchors just hold rods relative to the wood\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: The Master Layout 1. Draw a baseline near the front edge of the MDF 2. Draw two perpendicular lines going back 3. Draw the back line 4. Critical Check: Measure diagonals with a tape measure 5. Adjust lines until diagonals are exactly equal (to the millimeter)\nStep 2: Mount the Anchors 1. Print four “Base Anchor” brackets 2. Place them precisely on the drawn rectangle corners 3. Drill through the MDF 4. Use M8 or M10 carriage bolts from underneath (counter-bored flush) 5. Tighten anchors down with large washers and nuts\nResult: Four rigid plastic sockets fixed perfectly square to each other.\nStep 3: Drop-in Assembly 1. Verticals (Z): Slide M10 Z-rods into vertical sockets—they stand perfectly plumb 2. Horizontals (X & Y): Slide bottom rods through horizontal sockets 3. No measuring needed—anchors are already at correct distances\n\n\n\nFor any rectangular frame: - Measure from Front-Left to Back-Right - Measure from Front-Right to Back-Left - If these numbers are equal, the frame is perfectly square\nThe “Scavenger” Secret: If diagonals don’t match, slightly enlarge holes in the MDF to shift anchor brackets before final tightening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint four L-shaped tools that snap onto M12 rods at corners:\n\nTwo semi-circular channels for the M12 rods\nChannels placed at exactly 90° to each other\nKey Feature: Channels account for rod offset (different heights)\n\nAssembly Hack: Use zip-ties to hold rods in jigs while tightening nuts. Snip ties after nuts are locked.\n\n\n\nPrint two “Gauge Sticks” at your exact target internal dimension (e.g., 350mm):\n\nPlace sticks between brackets at the bottom, tighten\nMove same sticks to the top\nIf they don’t fit or are loose, you know which nut to turn\n\nThis eliminates tape-measure reading errors.\n\n\n\nBefore printing full brackets, print a test piece with three hole sizes:\n# Test 10.4, 10.6, and 10.8mm holes\nfor i, size in enumerate([10.4, 10.6, 10.8]):\n    # Create test holes in a simple block\nThe Goal: Find the hole where the rod slides in easily but doesn’t rattle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bottom corner brackets are different from top corners:\n\nMassive Flange: 100mm × 100mm × 15mm thick base plate\nThrough-Bolt Holes: 4 holes for mounting to MDF\nCentral Block: 60-70mm tall to hold the three offset rods\nZ-Rod Passthrough: Hole goes through to MDF so steel rod bears weight directly\n\n\n\n\n# Base Anchor Parameters\nflange_thickness = 15\nblock_height = 70\nm10_clearance = 10.5\n\nwith BuildPart() as base_anchor:\n    # 1.

Draw a baseline near the front edge of the MDF 2. Draw two perpendicular lines going back 3. Draw the back line 4. Critical Check: Measure diagonals with a tape measure 5. Adjust lines until diagonals are exactly equal (to the millimeter)\nStep 2: Mount the Anchors 1. Print four “Base Anchor” brackets 2. Place them precisely on the drawn rectangle corners 3. Drill through the MDF 4. Use M8 or M10 carriage bolts from underneath (counter-bored flush) 5. Tighten anchors down with large washers and nuts\nResult: Four rigid plastic sockets fixed perfectly square to each other.\nStep 3: Drop-in Assembly 1. Verticals (Z): Slide M10 Z-rods into vertical sockets—they stand perfectly plumb 2. Horizontals (X & Y): Slide bottom rods through horizontal sockets 3.

    "text": "✅ Still Relevant: This exploration of vibration damping and motor mounting strategies remains current. For canonical design decisions, see: - ADR-000: Engineering Philosophy (mass damping as core principle) - ADR-011: Laminated Plinth Baseboard (MDF damping) - ADR-009: Modular Puck & Spider Bed System (motor mounting) - ADR-005: Triple-Z Kinematic Leveling\nThis deep-dive explains the philosophy behind why mass damping + strategic motor placement is essential for scavenger builds.\n\n\n\n“The Tractor” addresses motor vibration through strategic mounting: Z-motors sink into the massive MDF base for mass damping, while X and Y motors use “Sandwich Mounts” with rubber isolation. This document covers mount designs, vibration control, and the Triple-Z bed system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStepper motors generate high-frequency vibrations during rapid direction changes. In a threaded-rod frame (especially M10/M12 steel), these rods can act like tuning forks, amplifying motor noise into audible “singing.”\n\n\n\nA two-pronged approach:\n\nMass Damping (Z-Motors): Mount directly to 36mm MDF “Anvil”\nMechanical Isolation (X/Y Motors): Sandwich mount with rubber grommets\nSoftware Compensation: Klipper Input Shaping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategy A (Flat Gasket): Motor pressed against rubber, but screws pass directly through to frame. Under belt tension, rubber compresses and vibration travels through metal screws.\nStrategy B (Sandwich Mount): Motor bolts to a “Sub-Plate.” That plate mounts to frame using rubber grommets. Motor screws and frame screws never touch each other. True mechanical isolation.\n\n\n\n[MOTOR]\n   ↓ (M3 bolts)\n[SUB-PLATE] ←── Small printed plate\n   ↓ (through rubber grommets)\n[FRAME BRACKET] ←── Main corner/anchor\n   ↓\n[M10 THREADED ROD FRAME]\nThe motor’s vibration path: 1. Motor → Sub-Plate (rigid connection) 2. Sub-Plate → Rubber → Frame Bracket (damped) 3. The frame never “feels” the motor directly\n\n\n\n\nHandles Belt Tension: Sub-plate distributes load; rubber doesn’t get crushed unevenly\nThicker Rubber Possible: Not limited to thin gaskets\nScavenger Friendly: Uses standard hardware store grommets\nIndustrial Aesthetic: Looks like proper machinery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don’t need “3D printer grommets”—standard electrical/plumbing parts work perfectly:\n\n\n\nSource\nProduct\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nElectrical Aisle\nWiring Grommet Assortment\nVarious sizes, rubber\n\n\nElectrical Aisle\nIP68 Cable Glands\nUse just the rubber insert\n\n\nPlumbing Aisle\nRubber Tap Washers\nSandwich between two washers\n\n\nBike Shop\nOld Inner Tubes\nLayer for custom thickness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC Power Supplies: Wire pass-through grommets\nMicrowave Ovens: Chassis wire grommets\nAny Appliance: Where wires pass through metal panels\n\nThe “Tap Washer” Alternative: If you can’t find grommets, sandwich the printed bracket between two rubber tap washers from plumbing section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is your main anchor that clamps to the M10 frame.

    "text": "⚠️ Outdated Tier System: This document uses the old Tier 0/1/2/3 framework and explores multi-PSU configurations. Current canonical decisions are in: - ADR-012: Mainboard & Host Architecture (electronics configuration) - ADR-016: Electronics & PSU Mounting Strategy - docs/reference/MASTER_PARTS_LIST.md (current PSU specs per configuration)\nWith the simplified two-donor model (ADR-025), most builds use scavenged PSUs; refer to current BOM for accurate specs.\n\n\n\nAmalgam requires power for seven stepper motors (1×X, 2×Y, 3×Z, 1×E), a hotend, heated bed, control boards, and cooling fans. A single scavenged PSU from a donor printer (typically 150W–250W) is often insufficient.

Check labels on heated bed (underside) 2. Check capacitor voltage ratings on boards 3. If it says “12V” → Do NOT connect to 24V PSU\n\n\n\nScavenged control boards have electrolytic capacitors (cylindrical components).\nThe Check: Look at the voltage rating printed on the capacitor. - If it says “16V” → Will explode on 24V - If it says “25V” or “35V” → Safe for 24V\nIf capacitors are underrated: Replace them or use that board only with a 12V PSU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSU is 350W+ at 24V\nHeated bed is 24V compatible\nAll components match PSU voltage\n\n\n\n\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                 MAINS AC INPUT                   │\n│            [Fused IEC Inlet + Switch]            │\n└─────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘\n                      │\n                      ▼\n              ┌───────────────┐\n              │    PSU 24V    │\n              │    350W+      │\n              └───┬───────┬───┘\n                  │       │\n               (+24V)   (GND)\n                  │       │\n       ┌──────────┴───────┴──────────┐\n       │                             │\n       ▼                             ▼\n┌─────────────┐              ┌─────────────┐\n│   Board 1   │──── USB ────│   Board 2   │\n│ (X,Y1,Y2,E) │              │ (Z1,Z2,Z3)  │\n└─────────────┘              └─────────────┘\n       │                             │\n       ▼                             ▼\n   [Hotend]                     [Heatbed]\n   [Fans]                       [Z-Motors]\n\n\n\n\nSingle point of failure\nMay brownout during bed heating + rapid moves\nLimited upgrade path\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad Distribution: Each PSU handles a manageable load\nIsolation: Electrical noise from bed heater separated from motion system\nRedundancy: If one PSU is marginal, the other compensates\nScavenger Reality: Two 200W PSUs are easier to find than one 400W\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth control boards must share the same reference for “zero volts.”\nThe Problem: Without common ground, the “0V” on Board A might be 0.5V different from Board B. This causes: - USB communication errors - Data corruption - Potential damage to Raspberry Pi USB ports\nThe Fix: Run a thick wire (14–16 AWG) between the Negative (−V or COM) terminals of both PSUs.\nPSU 1 [-V] ════════════════════ PSU 2 [-V]\n              (Common Ground)\n\n\n\nNEVER connect the +V terminals of two PSUs together.\nWhy: No two PSUs output exactly the same voltage. - PSU 1 might output 24.1V - PSU 2 might output 23.9V\nIf connected, they will “fight”—the higher voltage PSU tries to charge the lower one. This causes: - Excessive current flow between PSUs - Overheating - PSU failure - Potential fire\nThe Fix: Keep positive circuits completely isolated. - Board A gets +V ONLY from PSU 1 - Board B gets +V ONLY from PSU 2\n\n\n\nBoth PSUs must turn on and off together.\nThe Risk: If one PSU is on and the other is off while the printer tries to move: - “Back-powering” through stepper motors - Control board damage - Unpredictable behavior\nThe Fix: Wire both PSUs to a single fused AC inlet and power switch.\n\n\n\n\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                      MAINS AC INPUT                          │\n│               [Fused IEC Inlet + Switch]                     │\n│                    [Emergency Stop]                          │\n└─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┘\n                          │\n            ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐\n            │     Terminal Block        │\n            │   (Live/Neutral Split)    │\n            └─────┬───────────────┬─────┘\n                  │               │\n                  ▼               ▼\n          ┌───────────┐   ┌───────────┐\n          │   PSU 1   │   │   PSU 2   │\n          │   24V     │   │   24V     │\n          └─┬───────┬─┘   └─┬───────┬─┘\n            │       │       │       │\n         (+24V)  (GND)   (+24V)  (GND)\n            │       │       │       │\n            │       └───────┴───────┤  ← COMMON GROUND\n            │           ║           │\n            │           ║           │\n    ┌───────┴───┐       ║       ┌───┴───────┐\n    │  Board 1  │       ║       │  Board 2  │\n    │(X,Y1,Y2,E)│       ║       │(Z1,Z2,Z3) │\n    └─────┬─────┘       ║       └─────┬─────┘\n          │             ║             │\n          ▼             ║             ▼\n      [Hotend]          ║         [Heatbed]\n      [Fans]            ║         [Z-Motors]\n                        ║\n              (Common Ground Bus)\n\n    ⚠️ +24V lines NEVER connected between PSUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSU\nBoard\nComponents\nRationale\n\n\n\n\nPSU 1\nBoard 1\nX, Y1, Y2, Extruder, Hotend, Fans\n“Fast” motion, lower power\n\n\nPSU 2\nBoard 2\nZ1, Z2, Z3, Heatbed\n“Slow” motion, high power\n\n\n\nWhy This Split: -

This causes: - Excessive current flow between PSUs - Overheating - PSU failure - Potential fire\nThe Fix: Keep positive circuits completely isolated. - Board A gets +V ONLY from PSU 1 - Board B gets +V ONLY from PSU 2\n\n\n\nBoth PSUs must turn on and off together.\nThe Risk: If one PSU is on and the other is off while the printer tries to move: - “Back-powering” through stepper motors - Control board damage - Unpredictable behavior\nThe Fix: Wire both PSUs to a single fused AC inlet and power switch.\n\n\n\n\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                      MAINS AC INPUT                          │\n│               [Fused IEC Inlet + Switch]                     │\n│                    [Emergency Stop]                          │\n└─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┘\n                          │\n            ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐\n            │     Terminal Block        │\n            │   (Live/Neutral Split)    │\n            └─────┬───────────────┬─────┘\n                  │               │\n                  ▼               ▼\n          ┌───────────┐   ┌───────────┐\n          │   PSU 1   │   │   PSU 2   │\n          │   24V     │   │   24V     │\n          └─┬───────┬─┘   └─┬───────┬─┘\n            │       │       │       │\n         (+24V)  (GND)   (+24V)  (GND)\n            │       │       │       │\n            │       └───────┴───────┤  ← COMMON GROUND\n            │           ║           │\n            │           ║           │\n    ┌───────┴───┐       ║       ┌───┴───────┐\n    │  Board 1  │       ║       │  Board 2  │\n    │(X,Y1,Y2,E)│       ║       │(Z1,Z2,Z3) │\n    └─────┬─────┘       ║       └─────┬─────┘\n          │             ║             │\n          ▼             ║             ▼\n      [Hotend]          ║         [Heatbed]\n      [Fans]            ║         [Z-Motors]\n                        ║\n              (Common Ground Bus)\n\n    ⚠️ +24V lines NEVER connected between PSUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSU\nBoard\nComponents\nRationale\n\n\n\n\nPSU 1\nBoard 1\nX, Y1, Y2, Extruder, Hotend, Fans\n“Fast” motion, lower power\n\n\nPSU 2\nBoard 2\nZ1, Z2, Z3, Heatbed\n“Slow” motion, high power\n\n\n\nWhy This Split: - Heatbed electrical noise isolated from X/Y signals - High-current bed circuit on dedicated PSU - Z-motors move slowly, less sensitive to noise",

    "text": "This guide covers the practical setup and ongoing maintenance for Amalgam. Unlike the analysis documents (which explain why), this guide explains how — step-by-step procedures for keeping your printer running well.\nScope: Frame-agnostic procedures that apply to all paths (Scaffold, Mill, Lathe), with path-specific sections where needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore any motion system work, verify your frame is square.\nTools needed: - Machinist square or large framing square - Measuring tape or calipers - Feeler gauges (optional)\nProcedure:\n\nPlace printer on flat, level surface\nMeasure diagonals of the frame (corner to corner)\n\nDifference should be &lt;2mm for a 300mm frame\nIf larger, adjust frame joints before proceeding\n\nCheck vertical members with square against MDF base\n\nShould be 90° ±0.5°\n\nFor Scaffold path: check M10 rod parallelism\n\nMeasure spacing at top and bottom\nDifference should be &lt;1mm\n\n\nWhy it matters: A twisted frame causes binding, uneven wear, and dimensional inaccuracy that no amount of calibration can fix.\n\n\n\n\nTools needed: - Flat glass or granite surface plate - Soft mallet (optional) - Isopropyl alcohol and lint-free cloth\nProcedure:\n\nInspect rods — Roll each rod on flat glass\n\nWatch for wobble indicating bend\nBent rods: discard or straighten (difficult)\n\nClean rods — Wipe with IPA, remove all grease and debris\nInstall rod holders — Ensure holders are aligned and secure\n\nBoth holders for a rod should be in the same plane\n\nInsert rods — Slide in gently, don’t force\n\nIf binding, check holder alignment\n\nCheck parallelism — Measure rod spacing at multiple points\n\nMaximum deviation: 0.5mm over full length\n\nLight lubrication — Apply thin film of PTFE lubricant or light machine oil\n\nWipe excess — rod should not look wet\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools needed: - Eccentric nut wrench (8mm typically) - Piece of paper\nProcedure:\n\nIdentify eccentric nuts — Usually one per wheel set (bottom or back wheel)\n\nThe eccentric has an off-center hole\n\nLoosen all eccentric nuts — Wheels should spin freely\nPosition carriage — Place on V-slot rail\nAdjust first wheel set:\n\nTighten eccentric nut slowly while checking wheel contact\nGoal: wheel touches rail with light preload\nTest: slide piece of paper between wheel and rail\nCorrect: paper slides with slight resistance\nToo tight: paper won’t slide, or wheel won’t spin freely\nToo loose: paper slides freely, carriage wobbles\n\nRepeat for each wheel set — Carriage should move smoothly without wobble\nFinal check — Push carriage along full travel\n\nShould glide smoothly with consistent resistance\nNo tight spots or wobble\n\n\nCommon mistakes: - Over-tightening (causes flat spots, premature wear) - Under-tightening (causes wobble, poor print quality) - Adjusting while carriage is loaded (incorrect preload)\n\n\n\n\nTools needed: - Belt tension gauge (optional but recommended) - Zip ties (temporary holding)\nProcedure:\n\nRoute belt — Follow your path’s belt routing diagram\n\nTeeth face inward on pulleys\nAvoid twists\n\nSecure one end — Clamp or tie to carriage\nPull through — Route around pulleys and idlers\nInitial tension:\n\nPull belt taut by hand\nSecure second end\nBelt should “twang” when plucked (like guitar string)\n\nMeasure tension (if gauge available):\n\nTarget: 2-3 lbs (1-1.5 kg) deflection force\nAt mid-span, pressing ~10mm deflection\n\nFinal adjustment:\n\nToo loose: sloppy motion, lost steps, ringing\nToo tight: motor strain, bearing wear, noise\nJust right: solid feel, clean motion, no ringing\n\n\nCheck frequency: Monthly, or if print quality degrades\n\n\n\n\nTools needed: - Level - Calipers or ruler - Anti-backlash nut (if equipped)\nProcedure:\n\nInspect leadscrews — Check for bends, damage, contamination\n\nRoll on flat surface like smooth rods\nClean with IPA if dirty\n\nInstall anti-backlash nuts (if used):\n\nPre-load spring to manufacturer spec\nDon’t over-tighten — causes binding\n\nCouple to motors:\n\nUse flexible couplers (not rigid)\nAllow ~1mm axial play to prevent binding\nTighten set screws on motor shaft flat (if present)\n\nCheck alignment:\n\nLeadscrew should spin freely when decoupled from bed\nIf binding when coupled, alignment is off\n\nLubricate:\n\nLight grease (white lithium or PTFE)\nApply to threads, run up and down several times\nWipe excess\n\n\nTriple-Z specific: - All three leadscrews must be same length - Z-tilt calibration handles minor differences - Run Z_TILT_ADJUST after any Z-axis work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterval\nTask\nApplies To\n\n\n\n\nWeekly\nVisual inspection\nAll\n\n\nMonthly\nBelt tension check\nAll\n\n\nMonthly\nEccentric nut check\nMill only\n\n\nMonthly\nClean V-slots\nMill only\n\n\n3 months\nLubricate rods\nScaffold, Lathe\n\n\n3 months\nLubricate leadscrews\nAll\n\n\n6 months\nCheck bearing play\nScaffold, Lathe\n\n\n6 months\nCheck wheel wear\nMill only\n\n\nAnnually\nFull mechanical inspection\nAll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSigns belt needs attention: - Ringing artifacts in prints - Lost steps (layer shifts) - Clicking sounds during fast moves - Belt feels loose or too tight compared to initial setup\nProcedure: 1. Power off printer 2. Move carriage to mid-position 3. Pluck belt and listen to pitch - Compare to “reference pitch” you noted during setup - Or use tension gauge 4. Adjust tensioner if needed 5. Re-check after adjustment\n\n\n\n\nSigns adjustment needed: - Wobble in carriage (push side-to-side, check for play) - Wheels don’t spin freely - Uneven wheel wear - Print quality degradation\nProcedure: 1. Power off, move carriage to accessible position 2. Try to wobble carriage perpendicular to rail 3. If play detected, tighten eccentric slightly 4. If wheels don’t spin freely, loosen slightly 5. Re-test motion across full travel\n\n\n\n\nLubricant options: - PTFE dry lubricant (preferred — doesn’t attract dust) - Light machine oil (3-in-1, sewing machine oil) - White lithium grease (sparingly, for harsh environments)\nProcedure: 1. Power off, move carriage to end of travel 2. Wipe rod with lint-free cloth (remove old lube and debris) 3. Apply small amount of lubricant to cloth 4. Wipe along rod — thin, even film 5. Move carriage back and forth several times 6. Wipe any excess that accumulates at bearings\nWarning: Over-lubrication attracts dust and creates gummy residue. Less is more.\n\n\n\n\nProcedure: 1. Move bed to top of travel 2. Wipe visible leadscrew threads with cloth 3. Apply thin bead of PTFE grease or white lithium 4. Run bed up and down full travel 3-5 times 5. Wipe any excess that squeezes out\nFor Triple-Z: - Service all three leadscrews - Run Z_TILT_ADJUST afterward\n\n\n\n\nSigns of bearing wear: - Clicking or crunching sounds - Rough motion (not smooth glide) - Visible play in carriage - Witness marks on rods (shiny wear tracks)\nProcedure: 1. Remove carriage from rods 2. Roll bearing by hand — should be smooth, not gritty 3. Inspect rod surface for wear tracks 4. If wear detected: - Rotate bearing 90° to use unworn section - Or replace bearing 5. If rod shows significant wear track: - Rotate rod 90° (if mounting allows) - Or replace rod\nIGUS bearings: May squeak when dry — this is normal initially. If squeaking persists, ensure rod is clean (no oil — IGUS runs dry).\n\n\n\n\nSigns of wheel wear: - Flat spots (visible or felt as bumps during motion) - Grooves in wheel surface - Wheel doesn’t spin true (wobbles) - Increased play despite proper eccentric adjustment\nProcedure: 1. Remove carriage from rail 2. Inspect each wheel surface visually 3. Spin wheel by hand — should spin smoothly, no wobble 4. Check for flat spots by rotating slowly 5. Replace any worn wheels 6.

Heat hotend to printing temp (or +20°C for stubborn clogs) 2. While hot, use wrench to loosen nozzle - Counter-hold heater block to prevent spinning 3. Remove nozzle completely 4. Inspect nozzle bore — replace if damaged or worn 5. Install new nozzle: - Thread in by hand until finger-tight - Heat to printing temp - Final tighten (1/4 turn with wrench)\nWarning: Always tighten nozzles hot. Cold-tightening leads to leaks.\n\n\n\nSigns of issues: - Filament grinding in extruder - Heat creep (jams after running for a while) - Inconsistent extrusion\nProcedure: 1. Remove hotend from carriage 2. Heat to ~150°C, remove nozzle 3. Pull out heat break (may need heating/cooling cycles) 4. Clean inside with brass brush or drill bit (hand-turn only) 5. Inspect for damage — replace if bore is damaged 6. Apply thermal compound to threads (optional, helps heat transfer) 7. Reassemble and re-tighten nozzle hot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequency: Annually, or if intermittent issues occur\nProcedure: 1. Power off and unplug 2. Inspect all connectors for: - Corrosion (green or white deposits) - Loose connections - Melted plastic (overheating) 3. Disconnect and reconnect each connector - This cleans contact surfaces 4. Check screw terminals: - Wires should be secure, not loose - No exposed wire outside terminal 5. Inspect stepper cables for damage (especially at flexing points)\n\n\n\nFrequency: Every 3-6 months (dusty environment: monthly)\nProcedure: 1. Power off 2. Remove fan if accessible, or clean in place 3. Use compressed air to blow out dust - Hold fan blade to prevent spinning (generates voltage) 4. For heavy buildup, use soft brush 5. Reinstall and verify operation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep a maintenance log with: - Date of maintenance - What was done - Parts replaced - Issues found - Measurements (belt tension, bearing play, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nTracks wear patterns — helps predict replacement timing\nDocuments what worked — useful for troubleshooting\nEstablishes baseline — “was it always like this?”\n\n\n\n\nDate: 2026-01-15\nTasks: Monthly check\n- Belt tension: good (no adjustment)\n- Eccentric nuts: Y-axis slightly loose, tightened 1/8 turn\n- Visual: no issues\nNotes: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual check — nothing loose, no debris\n\n\n\n\n\nBelt tension — pluck test\nEccentric nuts (Mill) — wobble test\nClean build surface\n\n\n\n\n\nRod lubrication (Scaffold, Lathe)\nLeadscrew lubrication\nV-slot cleaning (Mill)\n\n\n\n\n\nBearing/wheel inspection\nConnection check\nFan cleaning\n\n\n\n\n\nFull mechanical inspection\nReplace wear items as needed\nRecalibrate (Input Shaping, Z-tilt)\n\n\n“A well-maintained tractor outlasts a neglected racecar.”",

    "text": "20 Years of RepRap Wisdom, Distilled\nThis document captures the engineering philosophy behind Amalgam. For the specific hardware specification, see ../REFERENCE-SPEC.md. For build instructions, see ../BUILDING.md.\n\n\n\nTo prove that Software Intelligence can overcome Analog Hardware. We build a “Tractor with the Brain of a Racecar”—using heavy, high-torque, battle-tested hardware and giving it extreme precision through Klipper.\n\nThe Tractor (Hardware): High-mass frames and geared extruders create a mechanical foundation that doesn’t flex, skip, or drift.\nThe Racecar (Software): Klipper’s software intelligence—Input Shaping and 3-Point Kinematic Leveling—gives this iron skeleton the precision of a high-end industrial machine.\n\n\n\nIn 2026, you can buy a 3D-printing “appliance” that is fast but fragile, or you can build a Mechanical Foundation. We chose the latter.\n\nLongevity over Velocity: While others chase 600mm/s, we prioritize a consistent 70-120mm/s baseline to ensure the machine prints identically on Day 1000 as it did on Day 1.\nTotal Sovereignty: You own every line of code and every bolt. Independent of proprietary ecosystems and cloud-lock.\nAccuracy: Dimensional consistency within ±0.1mm across the full build volume, enabled by a non-flexing frame and true kinematic leveling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmalgam adapts to your scavenged donors through three frame paths:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPath\nFrame\nMotion\nCharacter\n\n\n\n\nScaffold\nM10 Threaded Rod + MDF\nSmooth Rods + LM8UU\nHeritage — RepRap Darwin tribute\n\n\nMill\nAluminum Extrusion + MDF\nV-Slots + POM Wheels\nZero-waste — uses everything from Ender donors\n\n\nLathe\nAluminum Extrusion + MDF\nSmooth Rods + IGUS\nPrecision — superior motion quality\n\n\n\nAll paths share the same toolhead: Pitan extruder + E3D V6 hotend. This standardizes print quality across every Amalgam build regardless of frame type.\n\n\n\n\nIn engineering, we often talk about the “Iron Triangle” (Pick two: Fast, Cheap, or Good). But for 3D printing, a triangle is too simple. The Amalgam balances a Square of Constraints:\n         COST\n           |\n    EFFORT-+-QUALITY\n           |\n         SPEED\n\n\nOur primary constraint. To keep costs low, we sacrifice “Convenience.” Instead of buying a $150 pre-assembled toolhead, we print a Pitan extruder from $4-10 of vitamins. We trade money for Effort.\n\n\n\nThis is where most modern printers fail the triangle. Chasing 600mm/s requires expensive linear rails and lightweight carbon fiber—both of which blow the budget.\nThe Wisdom: We “settle” for 70–120mm/s. In 3D printing, 100mm/s with perfect quality is faster than 300mm/s with a 50% failure rate.\n\n\n\nThanks to Klipper, quality is no longer tied to the price of the hardware.\n\nInput Shaping cancels out the vibrations of our heavy frame\nPressure Advance manages the flow of our geared Pitan extruder\nThe Result: High-end quality on a “junk” budget by using software intelligence to solve analog hardware problems\n\n\n\n\nA machine can be cheap and high-quality, but usually that means it’s a “tinker-trap” (like a stock Ender 3).\nThe Amalgam approach: We use Overbuilt Hardware (heavy frame, geared Pitan, E3D V6). It takes more effort to build, but once running, it requires almost no maintenance.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you look at the last 20 years, the “Golden Ratio” of these trade-offs has shifted:\n\n2007 (Darwin Era): High Cost / Low Speed / Low Quality / Maximum Effort\n2014 (i3 Era): Medium Cost / Medium Speed / Medium Quality / Medium Effort\n2026 (Amalgam Era): Ultra-Low Cost / Medium Speed / High Quality / High Initial Effort\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you were to sum up the wisdom of those 20 years:\n\nMass is a Filter: A heavy machine is a quiet machine. Mass filters out the “noise” of cheap motors.\nGearing is Sovereignty: Direct drive is good, but Geared Direct Drive is king. The Pitan’s 3:1 gear ratio turns a cheap NEMA17 into a powerful, reliable extruder.\nSoftware is the Great Equalizer: Don’t spend $200 on rails if $0 of code (Klipper) can fix the vibration.\nThe “Good Enough” Zenith: Chasing the last 5% of speed costs 500% more money. The Amalgam lives at the “Zenith”—where performance is high, but the cost is still accessible.\nThe Bed is the Anchor: The frame serves the bed, not the other way around. We prioritize a quiet, immovable foundation.\nStandardize the Toolhead: All frame paths share the same Pitan + E3D V6 toolhead. This means every Amalgam—Scaffold, Mill, or Lathe—produces comparable print quality, and the community shares one set of print profiles.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe stand on the shoulders of giants.

    "text": "This guide helps Amalgam builders identify which donor printers provide the most value and what to expect from each. Not all printers are equal donors—some provide smooth rods, others don’t.\nTarget release: End of 2026 Expected donor pricing: ~$50 AUD per unit (secondhand market floor)\n⚠️ Cost Reality Check: Before you start shopping, read When NOT to Scavenge later in this guide. Amalgam makes financial sense only when donors are $100-150 each. Beyond that, commercial alternatives are competitive.\n💡 Budget for Contingencies: Expect to spend $80-150 on parts you can’t scavenge (M10 rods, M8 leadscrews, bearings, PSU, misc). See Parts Sourcing & Replacement Guide for how to source these if a donor part fails or is damaged. Total realistic budget: $250-380 AUD.\n\n\n\n\nThis section now uses fitness tiers based on bed size and Z-height (see ADR-026: Donor Fitness & Frame Constraints):\n\nTier 1 (Recommended): 200–235mm bed, &lt;280mm Z → Full support, no modifications\nTier 2 (Supported with notes): 235–300mm bed, 280–400mm Z → Works with heatbed swap or heavier MDF\nTier 3 (Unsupported): &gt;300mm bed, &gt;400mm Z → Not recommended, re-sell and buy Tier 1 donors\n\n\n\n\n\nAmalgam has three frame paths (see ADR-025):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPath\nComponent Match\nCommon Donors\nRecommendation\n\n\n\n\nScaffold\nTwo smooth-rod donors\nAnet A8, Wanhao i3, Prusa clones\nPrimary—buy M10 rods (~$30-45)\n\n\nMill\nTwo v-slot donors\nEnder 3, CR-10, Aquila\nPrimary—zero-waste, recommended\n\n\nLathe\nMixed: extrusion + smooth-rod\nRare; mixed donor scenarios\nFallback only—usually avoid\n\n\n\nLathe is rare: Most real-world printers are either all-smooth-rods (Scaffold path) or all-v-slots (Mill path). Extrusion + smooth-rod combinations are uncommon. If you have mixed donors, either: 1. Buy M10 rods and use Scaffold path (cheaper, simpler) 2. Build Lathe if you have good extrusions available\n\n\n\nComponent compatibility: Provide smooth rods AND bearings—the hardest parts to find cheap. Bed size: 200–235mm. Z-travel: &lt;280mm.\n\nAnet A8 / A6 → Tier 1 ✅ (220×220, 240mm Z)\nPrusa i3 clones → Tier 1 ✅ (Geeetech, Tronxy X3, CTC; 200–220mm bed, ~260mm Z)\nAnycubic i3 Mega → Tier 1 ✅ (210×210, 200mm Z)\nPrusa MK2 / MK2S → Tier 1 ✅ (250×210, 210mm Z; premium quality)\nPrusa MK3 / MK3S+ → Tier 1 ✅ (250×210, 210mm Z; premium quality, highest parts quality)\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent compatibility: V-slot motion system (no smooth rods), but excellent motors/electronics.

The A1 Mini is the better answer at this scale.\n\n\n\nAmalgam’s engineering (MDF damping, dual rods, box frame) solves stiffness problems that don’t exist at mini scale:\n\nRod sag analysis shows deflection scales with L³ (length cubed)\nAt 150mm spans, deflection is negligible even on flimsy hardware\nMini printers are already stiff due to their compact size\nYou’re solving a problem that isn’t there\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a mini printer:\n\nFlash Klipper — Adds Input Shaping, Pressure Advance, web interface\nTune it — Run resonance calibration, pressure advance test\nPrint — At this scale, they work fine with minimal upgrades\n\nPrusa Mini specifically: Already well-engineered.

You’d spend $80-120 for inferior capability\nNo documentation — Amalgam doesn’t support sub-200mm builds\nThe Rook exists — Purpose-built for exactly this use case\n\nBottom line: Mini printers are fine machines. Use them as-is with Klipper, or look at The Rook / The 100. Don’t try to force them into Amalgam.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a certain price point, dismantling an old printer costs more than its parts are worth.

Already enclosed, good frame, dual Z built-in, TMC drivers\nWhat to do: Flash Klipper firmware; use as-is\nBenefit: Working closed-loop system + Klipper’s best features\nDismantle cost: Labor &gt; parts value at this price\n\n\n\n\n\nMainboard: Proprietary; reverse engineering required for Klipper\nHotend: Proprietary cartridge system; incompatible with E3D V6\nBed system: Single-point support (sag issues, like Ender 5)\nFrame: Integrated design (can’t reuse cleanly)\nDonor value: Low; locked-down ecosystem\nWhat to do: Keep and upgrade with Klipper if you want it; don’t dismantle for parts\nReality: Parts salvage value &lt;&lt; disassembly effort\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything: Proprietary firmware, mainboard, hotend connectors, bed system\nIntegration: Tightly integrated; difficult disassembly\nDonor value: Very low\nCompatibility: None with standard Klipper builds\nWhat to do: Keep as-is or recycle; not a practical Amalgam source\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you buy an old printer to scavenge:\n\nIdentify two matched donors (both smooth-rod OR both v-slot)\n\nExample: Two Anet A8s, or Two Ender 3s\nAvoid mixing (requires extra purchases)\n\nCalculate total cost:\n\nDonor 1: $_____\nDonor 2: $_____\nMDF base: $15-20\nFrame material (M10 rods if Scaffold, $0 if Mill): $0-45\nMisc (bolts, wires): ~$40\nTotal: $____\n\nApply the rule:\n\nIf total &lt; $280 AUD: ✅ Good scavenger territory (matched donors)\nIf total $280-300 AUD: ⚠️ At parity with Bambu A1 Mini; reconsider\nIf total &gt; $300 AUD: ❌ Just buy a new commercial printer instead\n\nIf you find one printer, but no second match:\n\nDon’t overpay for a second one just to avoid buying M10 rods\nBuy M10 rods (~$35) and pick any other Scaffold-compatible donor\nOr buy a different matched pair\n\n\n\n\n\nEnclosed machines gain little from Amalgam disassembly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue\nImpact\n\n\n\n\nProprietary mainboards\nDon’t work with standard Klipper setups; reverse engineering required\n\n\nIntegrated frame + electronics\nCan’t reuse either cleanly; disassembly is destructive\n\n\nNon-standard hotends\nRequire custom mounts; incompatible with E3D V6 reference spec\n\n\nProprietary bed systems\nCan’t adapt to Amalgam’s Triple-Z leveling\n\n\nDifficult disassembly\nMore labor than the salvaged parts are worth\n\n\n\n\nBottom line: Amalgam is for matching donor pairs scavenged in the $100-150 each range. Enclosed, proprietary machines at $200+ are better left alone, upgraded whole with Klipper, or skipped entirely. Don’t pay premium prices for parts that will cost you premium labor to extract.\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes you’ll discover mid-build that a PSU is dead, a leadscrew is bent, or bearings are worn.\nSee Parts Sourcing & Replacement Guide for: - How to source replacements from AliExpress, Temu, eBay - How to spot counterfeits and avoid duds - Budget planning and decision tree - Common pitfalls (wrong pitch leadscrew, fake bearings, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\nADR-026: Donor Fitness & Frame Constraints (bed size, Z-height, stability physics)\nADR-025: Multi-Frame Architecture (Scaffold, Mill, Lathe paths)\nADR-021: Dual-Rod Motion System (rod requirements)\nADR-022: Linear Bearing Selection (bearing options, IGUS path)\nADR-024: Heated Bed Size Selection (bed compatibility)\nADR-012: Mainboard Architecture (dual-MCU configuration)\nParts Sourcing Guide: parts-sourcing-guide.md (replacement parts, avoiding counterfeits)\n\n\n“The code handles the permutations; the iron handles the quality.”",

Budget an additional $80-150 for parts you’ll likely source (M10 rods, M8 leadscrews, replacement bearings, PSU, etc.). See Parts Sourcing & Replacement Guide if a donor part fails or is damaged. Realistic total budget: $250-380 AUD.\n\n\nFitness: ✅ Tier 1 + Tier 1 → Fully Supported - Total cost: ~$100 AUD (two donors) - Frame path: Scaffold (M10 rods) + MDF base - Motion system: Dual 8mm smooth rods (scavenged) - Heatbed size: 220×220mm (reference spec) - Electronics: Dual-MCU Klipper - New parts required: M10 threaded rods (~$30–45), MDF (~$15–20) - Total Amalgam build: ~$160–190 AUD - Why excellent: Zero need to buy motion parts, perfect bed size, RepRap heritage\n\n\n\nFitness: ✅ Tier 1 + Tier 1 → Fully Supported (with ADR-025) - Total cost: ~$100 AUD (two donors) - Frame path: Mill (extrusions + V-slots) - Motion system: V-slot wheels (scavenged, zero-waste) - Heatbed size: 235×235mm (within Tier 1, works great) - Electronics: Dual-MCU Klipper - New parts required: 1× lead screw (~$8), MDF (~$15–20) - Total Amalgam build: ~$160–180 AUD - Why excellent: Zero rod/bearing purchase, perfect waste-free scavenging, 24V power supply included\n\n\n\nFitness: ✅ Tier 1 + Tier 1 → Fully Supported - Total cost: ~$100 AUD - Frame path: Scaffold (use Anet’s rod-based wisdom) - Motion system: 8mm smooth rods (from Anet, scavenged) - Heatbed: Ender 3’s 235×235 or Anet’s 220×220 (both work) - Electronics: Both mainboards contribute to Tier 2 dual-MCU - Advantage: Ender 3’s 24V PSU, Anet’s proven rods - Total: ~$160–190 AUD - Why good: Best of both worlds; no compromise on any component\n\n\n\nFitness: ✅ Tier 1 + Tier 1 → Fully Supported - Total cost: ~$200+ AUD (if you find an MK3 cheap) - Frame path: Scaffold or Mill (your choice) - Heatbed: Prusa’s 250×210 (rectangular, excellent) - Electronics: Einsy (5-driver TMC) + Creality board = overkill, but works - Bonus: SuperPINDA reference-spec probe, LM8LUU premium bearings, 24V PSU - Why premium: Highest quality scavenged parts, but hard to find MK3 cheap - Recommendation: Only pursue if MK3 &lt;$120. Otherwise, better to buy MK3 electronics new.\n\n\n\nFitness: ⚠️ Tier 2 + Tier 1 → Supported with Heatbed Swap - Total cost: ~$120 AUD (two donors) + $25–35 (heatbed swap) - Frame path: Mill - Motion system: V-slot wheels (scavenged from both) - Heatbed: Swap CR-10’s 300×300 to 220×220 (MK3 Dual Power ~$25–35) - Electronics: Dual-MCU (two Creality boards) - New parts: Lead screw (~$8) + heatbed (~$25) + MDF (~$15) - Total Amalgam build: ~$180–210 AUD - Why consider it: CR-10’s dual Z motors and better PSU; workable with mitigation - Note: Follow ADR-026 for heatbed swap process and MDF damping requirements",

MDF base provides damping, but there are physical limits. Tier 2 donors work great with simple mitigations (heatbed swap = $25–35). Tier 3 is beyond the scavenger philosophy—sell it and buy a matched Tier 1 pair.",

The A1 Mini is the better answer at this scale.\n\n\n\nAmalgam’s engineering (MDF damping, dual rods, box frame) solves stiffness problems that don’t exist at mini scale:\n\nRod sag analysis shows deflection scales with L³ (length cubed)\nAt 150mm spans, deflection is negligible even on flimsy hardware\nMini printers are already stiff due to their compact size\nYou’re solving a problem that isn’t there\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a mini printer:\n\nFlash Klipper — Adds Input Shaping, Pressure Advance, web interface\nTune it — Run resonance calibration, pressure advance test\nPrint — At this scale, they work fine with minimal upgrades\n\nPrusa Mini specifically: Already well-engineered. Just add Klipper. Don’t dismantle.\n\n\n\nIf you want a compact Klipper build, consider these purpose-built designs:\n\n\n\nProject\nBuild Volume\nPhilosophy\n\n\n\n\nThe Rook\n~150mm³\nCompact, Klipper-first, low cost\n\n\nThe 100\n~100mm³\nTiny, fast, educational\n\n\n\nThese are optimized for small format. Amalgam is optimized for 220mm bed slingers.\n\n\n\nTheoretically, yes — two minis could yield parts for a ~120mm box frame (probably M8 frame rods instead of M10). But:\n\nWhy bother? You’d spend $80-120 for inferior capability\nNo documentation — Amalgam doesn’t support sub-200mm builds\nThe Rook exists — Purpose-built for exactly this use case\n\nBottom line: Mini printers are fine machines. Use them as-is with Klipper, or look at The Rook / The 100. Don’t try to force them into Amalgam.",
