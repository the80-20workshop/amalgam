# Exports Directory

This directory contains generated CAD exports. **Contents are gitignored** - regenerate with:

```bash
cd cad
./build.sh build_all                    # STL only (default)
./build.sh build_all --format all       # All formats
./build.sh build_all --drawings         # Include technical drawings
```

## Subdirectories

| Directory | Format | Use Case |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| `stl/` | STL mesh | 3D printing |
| `step/` | STEP solid | CAD interchange (Fusion 360, FreeCAD, SolidWorks) |
| `3mf/` | 3MF mesh | Modern slicers (PrusaSlicer, OrcaSlicer) |
| `brep/` | BREP solid | build123d native (exact geometry, editable) |
| `gltf/` | glTF/GLB | Web 3D viewers, visualization |
| `drawings/` | SVG/PDF | Technical drawings (orthographic projections) |
| `logo/` | SVG | Brand assets |

## For Contributors

**Want to suggest a change to a part?**

1. Download the STEP file from `step/`
2. Open in your CAD software (Fusion 360, FreeCAD, etc.)
3. Make your modifications
4. Export and share (or describe the change in an issue)

We can't directly import your modified STEP, but it helps us understand your suggestion and update the build123d source.

## Regenerating

All exports are generated from Python scripts in `amalgam/parts/`. To regenerate:

```bash
# Single part
./build.sh build maker_coin --format all

# All parts
./build.sh build_all --format all --drawings

# Clean and rebuild
./build.sh clean
./build.sh build_all --format all
```

## Technical Drawings

The `drawings/` folder contains:
- `*_front.svg` - Front elevation
- `*_top.svg` - Top view (plan)
- `*_side.svg` - Side elevation
- `*_drawing.svg` - Combined sheet
- `*_drawing.pdf` - Print-ready PDF
