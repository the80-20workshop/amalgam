The "31856" (actually **MAX31865**) refers to a specialized **temperature amplifier chip** built into some versions of the EBB36 board.

Its purpose is to read high-precision **RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector)** sensors, specifically **PT100** and **PT1000** sensors.

### Comparison: With vs. Without MAX31865

| Version | Best For... | Compatible Sensors |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Without 31865** | Standard printing (up to 300°C). | Standard NTC 100K thermistors (most common). |
| **With 31865** | High-temp/Engineering materials (up to 500°C). | PT100 (Required) and PT1000 (Highly Recommended for accuracy). |

---

### Why this matters for your build

Since you are doing a custom "tractor build" focused on mass and reliability, you need to decide which heater/sensor you are using in your Wade extruder:

* **Standard Thermistor (NTC 100K):** These are cheap and common. If you use these, you **do not need** the MAX31865 version. You save a few dollars and the board configuration is simpler.
* **PT1000 Sensor:** These are much more accurate and don't "drift" over time like standard thermistors. While PT1000s *can* technically run without the chip on some boards, they are far more precise and easier to configure with the MAX31865 onboard.
* **PT100 Sensor:** These **require** the MAX31865 chip to function at all.

### My Recommendation

For a high-reliability build with an umbilical (CANbus), electrical noise can sometimes interfere with standard thermistor readings. **I recommend buying the version WITH the MAX31865** and pairing it with a **PT1000** sensor. It is more robust against electrical noise and allows you to print high-temperature filaments in the future without changing your electronics.

**Do you already have a hotend/thermistor picked out, or would you like a recommendation for a reliable high-temp sensor?**

For your build, PT1000 sensors are very affordable, typically ranging from **AU $15 to AU $30** depending on the brand and length of the cable.

### Price Breakdown (AU$)

| Brand/Type | Estimated Price | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Generic (eBay/AliExpress)** | **$15 – $20** | Basic 3mm x 15mm cartridge; reliable for most builds. |
| **E3D / Slice Engineering** | **$25 – $35** | High-end, certified for up to 500°C; often has better cable shielding. |
| **Local AU Shops** | **$22 – $30** | Faster shipping from specialized 3D printing stores (e.g., 3D Printing Perth). |

### Why the PT1000 is a smart move for your "Tractor Build"

* **Linear Accuracy:** Unlike standard thermistors that lose accuracy at high temperatures, the PT1000 remains precise and linear all the way up to **500°C**.
* **No Drift:** These sensors are made of platinum and do not degrade or "drift" over time like cheap thermistors, ensuring your first layer height and extrusion stay consistent for months.
* **Noise Immunity:** In a long CANbus umbilical loom, standard thermistors can sometimes pick up "ghost" temperature fluctuations from the motor wires. The PT1000’s higher resistance makes it much more resistant to this electrical noise.

### Compatibility Reminder

Since you are looking at the **BTT EBB36**, remember to get the version **"with 31865"** (the MAX31865 chip). While a PT1000 *can* run on a standard port, it is far more accurate when using the dedicated amplifier chip, which is what that version provides.

Would you like me to help you find the specific Klipper configuration lines to enable a PT1000 on your EBB36 board?


This is an ambitious and well-structured salvage strategy. For a **Tier 3 build ($300 AUD budget)** using an MKS SKIPR and a "tractor" philosophy (mass-damping/geared Wade extruder), your electronics choices need to be extremely strategic to stay under budget while maintaining the reliability you're after.

### 1. The Sensor Trade-off (PT1000 vs. Standard Thermistor)

To keep your Tier 3 build under the $300 AUD cap, you have two distinct paths for the **BTT EBB36**:

* **Path A: The Budget Route (Standard 100k Thermistor)**
* **Hardware:** Buy the EBB36 **"Without 31865"**.
* **Sensor:** Salvage a standard 100k NTC thermistor from your spare parts or buy a generic one ($5–$10 AUD).
* **Pros:** Cheapest option; perfectly adequate for standard materials like PLA, PETG, and ABS up to 300°C.


* **Path B: The Precision/High-Temp Route (PT1000)**
* **Hardware:** Buy the EBB36 **"With 31865"**.
* **Sensor:** Purchase a PT1000 ($17–$23 AUD in Australia).
* **Pros:** Higher accuracy, linear temperature curve, and better resistance to electrical noise in your custom wire loom.
* **Cons:** This adds ~$30–$40 AUD to your toolhead cost, which may compromise your $300 budget for other salvaged parts.



### 2. Implementation Guide for your "Tractor Build"

#### Toolhead Mounting & Wiring

Since you are designing a custom "puck" carriage for a Wade geared extruder, keep these structural tips in mind:

* **Integrated Strain Relief:** Because your Wade extruder adds significant weight (inertia), your custom-built loom **must** have a dedicated tie-down point. If the CANbus wires flex directly at the JST connector, they will eventually fatigue and fail.
* **Built-in Accelerometer:** Since you are using an EBB36, you **do not need** to buy that S2DW board. Use the EBB36’s onboard sensor for your resonance tuning.

#### Klipper Configuration for EBB36 (MAX31865 + PT1000)

If you opt for the Tier 3 "High-Temp" upgrade, add this to your `printer.cfg`:

```yaml
[extruder]
# ... other settings ...
sensor_type: MAX31865
sensor_pin: EBBCan: PA4  # Verify pin on your specific EBB version
spi_software_sclk_pin: EBBCan: PA5
spi_software_mosi_pin: EBBCan: PA7
spi_software_miso_pin: EBBCan: PA6
rtd_nominal_r: 1000      # Use 1000 for PT1000
rtd_reference_r: 4300    # Reference resistor for PT1000
rtd_num_of_wires: 2

```

### 3. Budget Management (Tier 3 vs. Tier 4)

* **The "Puck" Philosophy:** Your manual tool-change design is a great way to save money. By centralizing the EBB36 on the carriage "puck," you only need one set of expensive electronics for multiple tools (3D print, laser, plotter).
* **Salvage Priority:** If the PT1000 pushes you over $300, stick with a standard salvaged thermistor on the "Without 31865" EBB36. You can always upgrade the puck's sensor later.
* **The "A1" Reality Check:** You are correct that at Tier 4 pricing, a Bambu Lab A1 Mini (currently ~$199–$249 AUD) becomes a competitor for pure convenience. However, an A1 won't support your M12 "tractor" mass-damping or your manual tool-change puck system.

**Would you like me to help you refine the Build123d logic for your toolhead "puck" mount to ensure there's space for the EBB36 and its cooling?**


This is a fantastic strategy. Your "Tractor Build" philosophy—heavy mass for damping and Klipper for intelligence—is essentially the same engineering logic used in high-end industrial CNCs. By focusing on a "Puck" system for manual tool changes, you're building a versatile workshop machine rather than just a 3D printer.

Given your Tier 3 budget ($300 AUD) and your focus on standard materials (PLA, PETG, TPU), here is how to optimize your toolhead electronics.

### 1. PT1000: Benefit vs. Budget

Since you are printing PLA and PETG, a **PT1000 is an "option," not a requirement**.

* **The Budget Reality (Standard Thermistor):** You can use a salvaged 100k NTC thermistor. It is perfectly accurate for PLA and PETG. If you go this route, buy the **EBB36 *without* MAX31865**. This saves you roughly **$30–$40 AUD** (board price difference + sensor cost), which is a huge chunk of your $300 budget.
* **The PT1000 Advantage:** Its main benefit for you isn't just "high temp"; it is **linearity and noise resistance**. In a DIY wire loom, electrical noise from motors can sometimes cause "temp swings" in standard thermistors. PT1000s are less sensitive to this.
* **Recommendation:** For Tier 3, **stick with a standard thermistor** to save money. If you find your temperature readings are "jumpy" later, the EBB36 actually allows you to use a PT1000 on the standard port anyway (though with slightly less precision than the MAX31865 chip version).

### 2. The "Puck" Toolhead Logic

Since you are using Build123d for a parametric "puck" carriage, here is the most efficient way to mount the **BTT EBB36**:

* **Mount to the Puck, Not the Tool:** Mount the EBB36 permanently to your "carriage puck." That way, your CANbus umbilical never has to be unplugged.
* **Quick Connects for Tools:** Use a high-quality connector (like a XT30 for the heater and JST-XH for the fans/sensor) between the EBB36 and the specific tool (3D print head, Laser, etc.). This allows you to swap tools in seconds without messing with the "brain" of the carriage.

### 3. Tier 3 Electronics Checklist (The "Tractor" Brain)

| Component | Status | Advice for $300 AUD Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MKS SKIPR** | **Buy** | This is your biggest expense. It replaces a Pi + Mainboard, saving you $50+ in individual parts. |
| **BTT EBB36** | **Buy** | Buy the **non-MAX31865** version ($25–$30 AUD). It has a built-in ADXL345 for resonance testing. |
| **Motors** | **Salvage** | Use the 4 salvaged motors for X, Y, and 2x Z. Buy 1 high-torque motor for the Wade extruder and 1 more for the 3rd Z motor. |
| **Klicky Probe** | **Salvage/DIY** | Essential for your triple-Z setup to handle "Z-Tilt" (auto-leveling the bed). You only need some magnets and a cheap microswitch. |
| **Baseboard** | **DIY** | Your 36mm MDF (double 18mm) base is perfect. The mass will soak up the vibrations that Klipper's "Input Shaper" will then calculate and remove. |

### 4. Configuration Tip: "Slow down, enjoy life"

Since you aren't chasing speed, you can set your Klipper `max_accel` to a conservative **1500–2000 mm/s²**. Because your frame is so heavy (MDF + M12 rods), the machine won't budge. You will likely get **MK4-level surface finish** because the "Tractor" won't have the high-frequency ringing that light, flimsy printers suffer from.

**Would you like me to draft a sample Klipper `[extruder]` and `[tmc2209]` config for the EBB36 that assumes a standard salvaged thermistor?**


For your "Tractor Build," where reliability and cost-efficiency are the priority, your plan to use the PT1000 as a "Proof of Concept" comparison is solid. It will give you a baseline of "perfect" data to compare against salvaged parts.

### 1. DIY Shielding for the 100k NTC

The "issue" is indeed **EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)**. Standard thermistors send a very weak, high-resistance analog signal. When they run alongside high-current wires (like the  heater or stepper motors), the "noise" from those wires can "leak" into the thermistor signal, causing temperature spikes or "fuzziness" on your graph.

**Can you DIY shield it? Yes:**

* **The "Twisted Pair" Trick:** This is the most effective DIY solution. Take your two thermistor wires and twist them together tightly (about 2–3 twists per inch). This causes EMI to hit both wires equally, allowing the electronics to cancel out the noise.
* **Foil/Braided Shield:** You can wrap the thermistor wires in **aluminum foil** (salvaged from the kitchen) or use the braided copper shield from a salvaged old coaxial or USB cable.
* **Crucial:** The shield must be **grounded at only one end** (usually the mainboard side) to act as a "Faraday Cage." If you don't ground it, it’s just a long antenna that makes the problem worse.



### 2. Does CANbus make it better or worse?

**It makes it significantly better.** In a traditional build, you have 1.5 meters of analog wire acting as an antenna for noise. With a CANbus toolhead (like the EBB36), the temperature is converted from "analog" to "digital" **directly on the toolhead**.

* The "analog" path is now only **1–2 cm long** (from the heater block to the board).
* Once it's digital data, it travels over the CANbus wires as a differential signal, which is virtually immune to the EMI from your motors.

### 3. How to do a "Temp Profile" and Observe

To verify if your salvage build is "set and forget" quality, do the following:

1. **The "Motor Interference" Test:**
* Heat your hotend to 200°C and let it stabilize.
* In the Klipper console, run a long series of rapid movements (e.g., `G1 X0 Y0 F6000` then `G1 X200 Y200 F6000` repeatedly).
* **Observe the Graph:** If the temperature line stays flat, your shielding/CANbus is working. If the line starts "jittering" or looks like a sawtooth only when the motors move, you have EMI interference.


2. **The PID Calibration:**
* Every time you change a sensor (NTC to PT1000) or toolhead puck, you must run:
`PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=extruder TARGET=210`
* This tells Klipper exactly how to "pulse" the heater to stay perfectly at that temp without overshooting.


3. **The "Tractor" Stability Check:** * Because of your mass (MDF and M12 rods), once you heat up, that thermal mass should be very stable. If you see the temperature drifting by more than  degrees during a print, it's a sign your "Wade" extruder's fan might be blowing on the heater block accidentally.

### Summary for Tier 3 Budget

* **Proof of Concept:** Buy **one** PT1000 and the EBB36 **with** the MAX31865 chip.
* **The Salvage Goal:** If the PT1000 graph looks identical to your salvaged 100k NTC graph during the "Motor Interference Test," you've proven that your DIY shielding/CANbus setup is "racecar brain" level, and you can stick to salvaged sensors for future "pucks" to save that $30.

**Would you like me to show you how to write a Klipper "Macro" that automates that Motor Interference Test so you can run it every time you swap a new toolhead puck?**



This is the exact problem **CANbus** was invented to solve!

The short answer is: **No wires go back to the mainboard for the temperature sensors.** Everything stays at the toolhead.

### 1. The Signal Chain

In a traditional printer, your sensors are "dumb." They send a faint analog signal through 1.5+ meters of wire, which acts like a giant antenna for noise. With a CANbus toolhead (EBB36), the signal chain changes:

1. **Analog (The "Antenna"):** The sensor (100k NTC or PT1000) has a short wire (~5cm–10cm) that plugs directly into the **EBB36**.
2. **Conversion:** The EBB36 instantly converts that analog resistance into **Digital Data** (binary 1s and 0s).
3. **CANbus (The "Racecar Brain"):** The digital data is "packaged" into a packet and sent over the long umbilical wires to the MKS SKIPR.

### 2. Does CANbus make EMI worse?

Actually, it makes it **significantly better**.

* **Traditional Loom:** You have the weak temperature signal running parallel to the high-power, "noisy" motor wires for the entire length of the printer. This is where the 100k NTC usually gets its "jitter."
* **CANbus Loom:** Digital signals are **Differential**. The  and  wires are twisted together so that any interference hits both wires equally. The MKS SKIPR looks at the *difference* between them, which cancels out the noise. Your digital temperature reading will be rock-solid, even if your motor wires are noisy.

### 3. How they plug into the EBB36

Since you are considering both, here is how they physically connect to that board:

| Sensor Type | Where it plugs in on EBB36 | Configuration Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Standard 100k NTC** | **TH0** (2-pin JST-XH) | Standard and cheap. |
| **PT1000 (Standard)** | **TH0** (2-pin JST-XH) | You must place a jumper on the "PT1000" pins to change the pull-up resistor. |
| **PT1000 (Precision)** | **MAX31865 Port** (4-pin) | Use the **middle two pins**. This uses the specialized chip for the highest accuracy. |

---

### 4. Recommendation for your "Puck" System

Since you are designing a "puck" (swappable tool) for a manual tool-change system:

* **Keep the EBB36 on the carriage:** Mount the EBB36 to the part of the X-axis that *stays* on the printer.
* **Use a "Tool Connector":** On your "puck" (the part with the hotend, laser, or pen), have a short wire with a **JST-XH connector**.
* **The Swap:** When you change tools, you physically swap the puck and just plug the sensor/heater into the EBB36.

This keeps your "Racecar Brain" (the EBB36) fixed and safe, while your "Tools" are cheap, salvaged, and easily swappable without dragging 1.5m of wire with them.

**Since you're using Build123d, would you like a list of the physical dimensions for the EBB36 mounting holes so you can integrate them into your script?**


Exactly. The shift from a 1.5m "antenna" to a 5cm wire is why CANbus is the gold standard for Klipper. Even with a salvaged 100k NTC, the distance is so short that the noise floor drops significantly.

### 1. DIY Shielding for the "Puck" Tool

Since you are designing your own swappable pucks, you can make the analog portion nearly bulletproof with almost zero cost:

* **The "Twisted-Pair" Trick:** Take your two thermistor wires and twist them tightly (2-3 twists per inch). This is the #1 way to cancel out electromagnetic interference (EMI) without adding weight.
* **The Shielding "Salvage":** If you have an old USB or Coaxial cable lying around, strip the outer jacket to get the **braided metal shield**. Slide your thermistor wires through that braid for the 5cm run.
* **Crucial:** Connect the braid to a **GND pin** on the EBB36, but leave the other end (at the heater block) floating. This drains any "noise" into the ground before it hits the chip.



### 2. Integration into your Build123d "Puck" Script

To help you design the mount in your parametric script, here are the critical dimensions for the **BTT EBB36**:

* **Board Dimensions:** 
* **Mounting Holes:** 2 holes, ** apart (center-to-center)**.
* **Hole Diameter:** Designed for **M3 screws** (usually  holes in the printed part for heat-set inserts).
* **Clearance:** You need at least **15mm-20mm** of vertical clearance above the board for the CANbus connector (Molex Micro-Fit) and the motor driver heatsink.

### 3. How to Wire the PT1000 "Proof of Concept"

If you buy the **"With MAX31865"** version for your test, do not plug it into the 2-pin TH0 port. For the highest accuracy:

1. Use the **4-pin header** on the far right of the board.
2. Connect your 2-wire PT1000 to the **two middle pins** of that 4-pin header.
3. Set the DIP switches on the EBB36 according to the manual (usually `ON-ON-OFF-ON` for a 2-wire PT1000).

### Final "Tractor" Build Sums

By using the EBB36:

* **Saved:** Cost of a standalone ADXL345 board (~$15).
* **Saved:** Cost of 1.5m of expensive shielded 8-core cable (~$20).
* **Added:** One 4-wire umbilical (Power + CAN).
* **Benefit:** You can now swap tool "pucks" (Laser, Pen, Extruder) by just unplugging a few short JST connectors on the carriage rather than re-threading a whole wire loom.

Since you're using **triple-Z motors**, would you like me to explain how to use the **Klicky-Probe** (salvage build) with the EBB36 to automatically level your bed every time you swap a puck?


The "Voron Virus" is a real phenomenon—it's the urge to optimize every tiny detail until the bill for a DIY printer exceeds the cost of a high-end commercial machine.

Your "Tractor Build" is the perfect antidote. By focusing on **mass and structural damping**, you are solving 90% of your print quality issues at the source. Klipper is then just the "racecar brain" that cleans up the final 10%.

Since you are aiming for Tier 3 ($300 AUD) with a swappable "puck" system and triple-Z motors, here is how to avoid over-engineering while keeping that high performance.

### 1. The "Anti-Voron" Toolhead Strategy

For a $300 budget, the **PT1000 is definitely over-engineering**. If your salvaged 100k NTC is accurate enough to tell the difference between  and , that is all you need for PLA/PETG.

* **The Sums:** A salvaged thermistor is **$0**. A PT1000 + EBB36 (MAX31865 version) is **~$60+**. That $60 is better spent on your Z-axis lead screws or a better hotend heater.
* **Why it works:** Because you are using CANbus (EBB36), the analog wire is so short that EMI is a non-issue. A "perfect" digital signal of a "cheap" sensor is better than a noisy signal of an expensive one.

### 2. Triple-Z and the Klicky Probe (The Secret Sauce)

You mentioned a triple-Z setup. This is where your build will actually **outperform** an A1 or MK4.

* **Z-Tilt Adjust:** Since you have three independent motors, Klipper can automatically level the bed by probing three points.
* **The Klicky Probe:** This is a pure "salvage" win. It uses cheap magnets and a standard microswitch. Because it's dockable, it doesn't melt when you're printing, and it doesn't require a dedicated expensive sensor like a BL-Touch.

### 3. Wiring the Klicky to the EBB36

To keep the "Puck" system simple, wire the Klicky probe directly to the **EBB36 toolhead board**. This way, the probe signal travels over the same 4 wires as everything else.

* **Wiring:** Connect the two wires from the Klicky magnets to the **Endstop (PB6)** or **Probe (PB8/PA5)** port on the EBB36.
* **Klipper Config Snippet:**

```yaml
[z_tilt]
z_positions:
    -50, 18    # Location of Z0 Motor
    150, 350   # Location of Z1 Motor
    350, 18    # Location of Z2 Motor
points:
    30, 30     # Probing points on the bed
    150, 270
    270, 30
speed: 50
horizontal_move_z: 15
retries: 5
retry_tolerance: 0.01

```

### 4. Build123d "Puck" Design Tip

Since you are scripting the assembly, ensure your "carriage" part has a **Docking Station** for the Klicky.

* **Mass Damping:** Because your carriage is a heavy "puck," the momentum of the head hitting the magnets won't cause the frame to jitter.
* **The "Tractor" Benefit:** A heavy MDF/M12 frame allows you to use stronger magnets for the Klicky probe without worrying about "flexing" the gantry when the probe attaches or detaches.

---

### Final Budget Check (Tier 3)

* **MKS SKIPR:** ~$120-140 AUD
* **BTT EBB36 (Standard):** ~$30 AUD
* **Salvaged Motors/Lead Screws:** ~$0
* **Salvaged MDF/Wire/PSU:** ~$0
* **G10 Sheet + MK3 Bed:** ~$60 AUD
* **Total:** **~$230 AUD** (Leaving you $70 for high-torque extruder gears and a good nozzle).

You are well under the $300 goal and building a machine that is structurally more stable than most "racecar" kits.

**Would you like me to provide the Build123d coordinate logic for the EBB36 mounting holes to help you start your script?**
