To truly achieve the "Red Pill" philosophy of your **Neo-Darwin** manifesto, your builders need to know that the most precise parts of the machine—the linear rods—don't have to be bought. They can be harvested from the "skeletons" of 20th-century office tech.

Here is a draft for the **"Scavenger’s Guide to Free Iron"** section of your manifesto.

## 🛠️ The Scavenger’s Guide to Free Iron

In the Neo-Darwinian worldview, a junked office machine is not waste; it is a **high-precision organ donor**. While you can buy 10mm rods, scavenging them provides superior industrial-grade steel for $0.

### 1. The "Golden" Donor: Large Office Photocopiers

If you find a floor-standing Xerox or Konica Minolta at an e-waste center, you have found the motherlode.

* **The Prize:** These contain long, precision-ground steel shafts, often in **10mm and 12mm diameters**.
* **Quality:** These rods are designed to move heavy scanner glass or paper drums with micron-level repeatability for millions of cycles.
* **Other Vitamins:** You will also find high-quality **NEMA 17 or NEMA 23 stepper motors**, cooling fans, and robust 24V power supplies.

### 2. The "Silver" Donor: Desktop Laser Printers

Old HP LaserJets or Brother printers are everywhere.

* **The Prize:** They typically yield **8mm smooth rods**. While thinner than the Reference Spec, our `build123d` script adapts the "Tractor" to use these instantly.
* **The Yield:** A single mid-sized laser printer can yield up to **17 steel bars** and a collection of useful microswitches for your ERCF multi-color unit.

### 3. The "Bronze" Donor: Flatbed Scanners

Even a slim desktop scanner is worth cracking open.

* **The Prize:** Usually a single, very high-quality **8mm rod** (approx. 400mm long).
* **Bonus:** They often contain a small stepper motor and an **optical endstop**—perfect for high-precision homing if you aren't using sensorless TMC drivers.

### ⚠️ The Scavenger’s Safety Protocol

* **Toner is Toxic:** Always wear gloves and a mask when opening a laser printer. Toner is an ultra-fine plastic powder that is "icky" for your lungs.
* **Check the Rods:** Before taking a rod home, roll it on a flat piece of glass. If it wobbles or light shines under it, it's bent and useless for a 3D printer.
* **Cleaning:** Scavenged rods often have "black goo" (a mix of old oil and dust). Clean them with isopropyl alcohol and a light sand with 1200-grit paper if they have any surface oxidation.

### What I can do next for your project:

Since you’re using **build123d** to create a parametric "webservice," would you like me to:

1. **Draft the Python logic** for how the script should handle the "8mm vs 10mm" rod diameter choice in the STL generation?
2. **Help design the questionnaire flow** that users will fill out to generate their "bespoke" manual?
3. **Refine the "Triple-Z" Klipper configuration** logic so it's easy for a beginner to paste into their `printer.cfg`?
