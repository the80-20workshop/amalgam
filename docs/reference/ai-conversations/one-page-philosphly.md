# Document 1: One-Page Design Philosophy

## Purpose

This project exists to enable people to **build capable, high-quality 3D printers using scavenged, reused, and widely available parts**, without sacrificing print quality or requiring specialised supply chains.

The goal is not to build the *fastest*, *lightest*, or *most precise* printer. The goal is to build a **printer that many people can realistically build, understand, modify, and maintain**.

## Core Principles

### 1. Accessibility over Optimisation

Design choices prioritise **availability, simplicity, and reuse** over theoretical performance gains. If a part is difficult to source, proprietary, or requires a specialised kit, it cannot be a reference component.

A design that performs 95% as well but is buildable by twice as many people is the superior design.

---

### 2. No Quality Penalty for Lower Tiers

All build tiers must be capable of producing **equivalent print quality**.

Higher tiers reduce:

* wiring complexity
* sourcing difficulty
* configuration effort

They **do not** unlock better prints.

Lower-tier builders are not building an inferior printer — they are building the *same printer* with more effort and ingenuity.

---

### 3. Scavengability Is a First-Class Requirement

Reference designs must:

* tolerate part variation
* accept imperfect or reused components
* work with metric hardware commonly found in old printers, appliances, or office equipment

If a design assumes precision parts or narrow tolerances, it is optional by definition.

---

### 4. Mechanical Honesty

The printer should be understandable as a machine.

Designs should:

* expose how forces flow
* favour visible, inspectable mechanisms
* avoid hidden complexity

This supports learning, debugging, and modification — key RepRap values.

---

### 5. Evolution, Not Replacement

The printer is designed to evolve:

* parts may be replaced
* subsystems may be upgraded
* configurations may vary

But **the core architecture remains stable**, so improvements do not fragment the ecosystem.

---

## Philosophy Summary (Short Form)

> *Build the simplest machine that prints well, using the parts people already have, and allow complexity only where it genuinely reduces burden — never just because it is possible.*
