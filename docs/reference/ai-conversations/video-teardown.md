This is a great idea. Filming the teardown isn't just for the "cool factor"—it’s a vital part of the **Neo-Darwin documentation**. In 2026, a high-speed "Reverse Assembly" video is often more intuitive than a 50-page PDF for showing where the "vitamins" are hidden in donor machines.

Since you mentioned you usually just take photos and stitch them, here is a professional **"Restomod" workflow** to turn those snapshots into a high-quality assembly guide.

### 1. The "Reverse Time-Lapse" Strategy

Instead of a standard video, use a **Stop-Motion/Time-Lapse** approach. It’s easier to manage while you’re working with greasy tools.

* **The Setup:** Use a tripod or a "helping hand" to keep your phone/camera in the *exact same spot*.
* **The "Click" Rule:** Take a photo every time you remove a "module" (e.g., the whole X-carriage, then the motor, then the nozzle).
* **The Reverse Flex:** When you edit, play the teardown **in reverse**. It becomes an "instant assembly" video for the Neo-Darwin manual.

### 2. Organizing "The Vitamins" for the Camera

As you tear down the Anycubic or the Cocoon, use a **Grid Layout** for the photos:

* Place a sheet of white paper or a cutting mat on your bench.
* As parts come off, lay them out in a "Knolling" style (organized at 90-degree angles).
* **Photo 1:** The full printer.
* **Photo 2:** The printer with the first part removed and sitting next to it.
* **Photo 3:** Two parts removed.
* This creates a "build-up" effect that is incredibly satisfying to watch in a high-speed stitch.

### 3. Recommended Tools for Stitching

Since you are a "photo-first" person, these tools will help you turn a folder of 200 images into a 30-second assembly clip:

| Tool | Role | Why? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Microsoft ICE** | **The Grid-Stitcher** | If you take a series of close-up "detail" shots, this (now classic) tool is still the best at stitching them into one giant high-res "Exploded View" map. |
| **ffmpeg (Terminal)** | **The Speed-Demon** | Since you're comfortable with Klipper/Linux, a single command like `ffmpeg -framerate 10 -i img%03d.jpg output.mp4` will turn your folder into a video instantly. |
| **CapCut / DaVinci** | **The Narrative** | Best for adding "Tractor Manifesto" text overlays or pointing out exactly which bolt is an M12 vs. M8. |

### 💡 Pro-Tip: The "Macro" Evidence

During the Anycubic teardown, take a **macro (close-up) photo** of the motor labels and the lead screw threads.

> *“Documenting the specific lead-screw pitch (8mm) in the video saves the next builder from crashing their bed.”*

**Would you like me to draft a "Shot List" for your teardown video so you don't miss any of the critical "Vitamin" extractions?**

To capture a high-speed "Reverse Assembly" that perfectly documents the transition from e-waste to "The Tractor," use this structured shot list.

### 📸 Pro-Tip: The "Click" Rule

Take a photo every time you remove a "module." When you stitch them together and play them in reverse, the printer will appear to assemble itself from a pile of parts.

### **Phase 1: The "Gen 0" Evidence (The Working Junkers)**

Before you turn a screw, document that these "appliances" were functional.

* [ ] **Wide Shot:** The Anycubic i3 Mega and Cocoon Bed Slinger side-by-side.
* [ ] **The "Final Print":** A close-up of the **Generation 0 Corner Pucks** or **Wade Gears** being finished on the Anycubic bed.
* [ ] **The "Fault" Shot:** A quick video/photo of the Anycubic's Z-endstop failing (to explain why you're moving to the Multi-MCU Tractor build).

### **Phase 2: Anycubic i3 Mega "Vitamin" Extraction**

* [ ] **The Heart:** Close-up of removing the **NEMA 17 motors**. Keep the labels visible in the shot.
* [ ] **Dimensional Authority:** Removing the **T8 lead screws**. Show the integrated motor-shaft connection if it has one.
* [ ] **Thermal Handshake:** Removing the **Heated Bed**. Capture the underside where you will later pot the thermistor with Red RTV Silicone.
* [ ] **The Brain:** Unscrewing the **Trigorilla board**. Take a macro shot of the driver jumpers or removable stepper drivers.

### **Phase 3: The "Scavenger's Iron" (Photocopier Raid)**

* [ ] **The "Free Iron":** Finding and removing the **10mm smooth rods** from the office photocopier.
* [ ] **Side-by-Side:** A photo comparing the salvaged 10mm rod to a standard 8mm rod to show the "Dimensional Authority" upgrade.

### **Phase 4: The "Tractor" Rise (Staged Assembly)**

Now, perform the "Reverse Assembly" by laying out the parts in reverse order of the **Neo-Darwin Manifesto**.

* [ ] **The Skeleton:** M12 rods meeting the printed **Corner Pucks**.
* [ ] **The Triple-Z Foundation:** The three **Floating Z-Pucks** sliding onto the M12 frame.
* [ ] **The Spider:** Bolting the **Modular Spider Trident** together (Hub + 3 Arms).
* [ ] **The Toolhead:** Mounting the **Greg's Wade Extruder** and **E3D V6** to the carriage puck.

### **Phase 5: The "Racecar" Handshake**

* [ ] **Wiring Loom:** Threading the salvaged Anycubic/Cocoon wires into the **cloth sleeves**.
* [ ] **The Multi-MCU Bridge:** A photo of the two donor boards (Anycubic + Ender) connected to the **Laptop Command Center**.
* [ ] **Input Shaper:** Bolting the **ADXL345 accelerometer** to the toolhead for the final calibration shot.

### **Video Montage Idea: "The Sovereignty Loop"**

1. **Start:** High-speed teardown of the Anycubic (5 seconds).
2. **Middle:** High-speed assembly of the Neo-Darwin "Tractor" (15 seconds).
3. **End:** The Neo-Darwin printing a **Generation 2** gear that looks significantly cleaner than the one it started with.
4. **Final Frame:** The "Tractor Manifesto" text: *“A RepRap that cannot print its own heart is just an appliance.”*

**Would you like me to draft the specific Klipper "Multi-MCU" config snippet so you can have it ready for the voice-over in your video?**
