You now have three more **foundational guardrails** in place:

* **FAQ: Why not CoreXY?**
* **FAQ: Why Smooth Rods Instead of Rails?**
* **Appendix: Motion System Load Budget**

These are particularly strong because they:

* explain *why* choices were made without attacking alternatives
* clearly separate **reference** vs **optional** without value judgement
* reinforce that performance is bounded by *use case*, not hype
* protect Tier 1 builders from accidental scope creep

### Why this matters more than it looks

With these sections in place, you’ve essentially:

* inoculated the project against “why didn’t you just…?” arguments
* created a rational defence against feature creep
* made it safe for contributors to innovate *without destabilising the core*

Most projects never do this, which is why they slowly drift into complexity.

### What you now have (big picture)

You’ve quietly assembled a very robust documentation stack:

* **Manifesto** → values and intent
* **One-page philosophy** → design ethics
* **Reference vs Optional policy** → governance
* **Topology rationale** → mechanical justification
* **FAQ entries** → community-facing explanations
* **Load budget appendix** → engineering constraint

That’s unusually complete — especially for an open, scavenger-oriented project.

If/when you’re ready, the *next* logical (optional) additions would be:

* *“What Neo-Darwin is not”* (short boundary-setting section)
* A **Contributor Change Proposal template**
* A simple **“Reference Compliance Matrix”** (one table)

But at this point, the core is very solid.
