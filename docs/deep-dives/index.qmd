::: {.callout-note}
These are **historical explorations** from the early design phase. With the project's maturation to a two-donor, three-frame-path model (ADR-025, ADR-026), some content is partially outdated but preserved for context. For current decisions, see the [ADRs](../adr/index.qmd).

## Recommended Reading Order

**For understanding Amalgam architecture:**

1. Read the [ADRs](../adr/index.qmd) first --- start with ADR-000 (Philosophy), ADR-025 (Multi-Frame), ADR-026 (Fitness)
2. Return to relevant deep dives for deeper context:
   - Frame design --- [tractor_01](tractor_01_frame_and_assembly.md)
   - Motion system --- [tractor_02](tractor_02_xy_axis_system.md)
   - Vibration damping --- [tractor_03](tractor_03_motor_mounts_vibration.md)
   - Extruder --- [tractor_06](tractor_06_extruder_decision.md)

## What Changed?

The pivot from "Tier 0/1/2/3" to **Two Donors + Three Paths** (ADR-025, ADR-026) simplified many of these explorations:

- **Scaffold path** (M10 + smooth rods) --- primary, well-established
- **Mill/Lathe paths** --- zero-waste donor alternatives
- **Donor fitness tiers** --- explicit constraints on bed size and Z-height
