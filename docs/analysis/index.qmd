subtitle: "Technical calculations and measurements validating Amalgam design decisions"
---

This section contains physics-based analysis that validates design choices and supports parametric configuration. Use these when you need to understand the engineering behind Amalgam or explore trade-offs.

## Analysis Documents

| Document | Key Insight |
|----------|-------------|
| [Rod Sag Analysis](rod-sag-analysis.md) | M8 vs M10 deflection at various spans; max safe acceleration per rod diameter |
| [Z-Height Analysis](z-height-analysis.md) | Leadscrew whip, frame resonance, and why 280mm is the practical limit |
| [Single vs Dual Rod](single-vs-dual-rod.md) | Why single rods have 4x deflection and can't resist rotation |
| [Motion System Comparison](motion-system-comparison.md) | Precision, wear, and maintenance differences between rods and V-slots |

## What These Validate

- **ADR decisions** --- Physics-based justification for design choices (e.g., why M10 frame, why MDF damping)
- **Parametric defaults** --- `config.py` settings based on tested ranges
- **Tuning guidance** --- Input Shaping, acceleration profiles per frame path
- **Fitness constraints** --- ADR-026 stability analysis for bed size and Z-height
