title: "Architecture Decision Records"
---

Amalgam documents every major engineering decision as an Architecture Decision Record (ADR). Each ADR captures context, alternatives considered, rationale, and consequences.

## Reading Order

If you're new to Amalgam, read in this order:

1. **[ADR-000: Engineering Philosophy](000-engineering-philosophy.md)** — Core principles: Mass, Software, Gearing, trade-offs
2. **[ADR-025: Multi-Frame Architecture](025-multi-frame-architecture.md)** — Scaffold, Mill, Lathe paths (all on MDF base)
3. **[ADR-026: Donor Fitness & Constraints](026-donor-fitness-constraints.md)** — Bed size, Z-height, stability limits
4. **[ADR-021: Dual-Rod Motion System](021-dual-rod-motion-system.md)** — Dual 8mm vertical stacking
5. **[ADR-012: Mainboard & Host Architecture](012-mainboard-host-architecture.md)** — Electronics paths, dual-MCU config
6. **[ADR-019: Pitan Extruder](019-pitan-extruder.md)** — Single-drive, 3:1 geared
7. **[ADR-004: E3D V6 + CHT](004-v6-cht.md)** — Hotend selection

## ADR Lifecycle

- **Accepted** — Decision finalized, implemented
- **Superseded** — Replaced by newer ADR, kept for decision history
- **Archived** — No longer relevant, kept for historical reference

## Creating New ADRs

Use the template at [`template.md`](template.md). Number sequentially from the highest existing ADR.
