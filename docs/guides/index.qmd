Assembly, configuration, and calibration guides for Amalgam builds.

::: {.callout-note}
## Reference Spec Values
Guides that use configuration variables (marked with *) render with the reference spec defaults: 220mm bed, Scaffold path, Triple-Z, MKS SKIPR. For a personalized build guide, run `python scripts/wizard.py` to generate your `config.py`, then render locally.

## Personalized Assembly Manual

The full step-by-step assembly manual is generated locally from your `config.py` and is not published on this website. To generate it:

```bash
python scripts/wizard.py                              # configure your build
python scripts/export_config.py > docs/_variables.yml # export variables
cd docs && quarto render                              # render locally
```

This produces assembly instructions tailored to your specific donors, bed size, frame path, and electronics.
