# Amalgam Print Settings

Recommended settings for printing Amalgam parts. These are suggestions — the parts work in any color and without texture. But following the brand palette gives your build a distinctive, intentional look.

## The Palette

Amalgam uses a three-color system from cheap, universally available filaments:

| Role | Color | Hex | Used For |
|------|-------|-----|----------|
| **Body** | Dark Grey | {{< var brand_body_color >}} | All printed parts |
| **Accent** | White | {{< var brand_accent_color >}} | Logo pads (filament swap) |
| **Base** | Near-Black | {{< var brand_base_color >}} | MDF base (painted), aluminum extrusions |

**Visual hierarchy:** Black base and frame → Dark grey printed parts with white logos → Silver hardware (bolts, rods, bearings).

### Why These Colors?

- **Grey is the tractor color.** Cast iron, concrete, industrial machinery — all grey. It's the one color no other printer project owns.
- **White logos pop** against dark grey without being flashy. Same contrast as the website and logo.
- **Black base disappears**, letting the grey structural parts stand out.
- **All three filament colors are the cheapest available.** No specialty colors needed.

## Logo Pads

::: {.callout-note}
Logo pads are currently **{{< var logo_pad_enabled >}}** in your config.
Pad size: {{< var logo_pad_diameter >}}mm, raised {{< var logo_pad_height >}}mm.
:::

Each structural part has a small raised pad with the Amalgam octagon+A mark. The pad is {{< var logo_pad_height >}}mm above the surface — just 2-3 print layers at standard settings.

### Single-Swap Color Change

No multi-material unit (MMU) required. Just one filament swap:

1. **Slice the part** in your grey filament as normal.
2. **Add a pause** at the logo pad layer height (the layer where the raised pad starts).
3. **Swap to white filament** when the printer pauses.
4. **Resume printing.** The logo pad prints in white.
5. **Swap back to grey** after the pad completes (2-3 layers later), or leave white for the remaining top layers if the logo is the highest feature.

#### Slicer-Specific Instructions

**PrusaSlicer / OrcaSlicer:**

1. Slice the part and open the layer preview.
2. Find the layer where the logo pad starts (look for the small octagon appearing).
3. Right-click the layer slider → "Add custom G-code" → type `M600` (filament change).
4. Optionally add another `M600` 2-3 layers later to swap back.

**Cura:**

1. Install the "Filament Change" post-processing script (Extensions → Post Processing → Modify G-Code).
2. Set the layer number where the logo pad begins.
3. The printer will pause for filament change at that layer.

**Bambu Studio:**

1. Right-click on the layer bar at the logo pad layer.
2. Select "Add filament change."

### Disabling Logo Pads

Set `LOGO_PAD_ENABLED = False` in `cad/config.py` to generate parts without logo pads. The parts are structurally identical either way.

## Fuzzy Skin (Texture)

::: {.callout-tip}
## The "Cast Iron" Look
Fuzzy skin on cosmetic surfaces gives printed parts an industrial textured finish that:

- **Hides layer lines** (forgiving on a scavenger-built printer)
- **Adds grip** (textured corners hold rods better during assembly)
- **Looks intentional** (distinguishes from generic smooth prints)
:::

### Recommended Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Point Distance** | {{< var fuzzy_skin_point_distance >}} mm |
| **Thickness** | {{< var fuzzy_skin_thickness >}} mm |
| **Apply to** | Outer surfaces only (not mating faces) |

### Where to Apply

- **Yes:** Outer faces of corners, visible bracket surfaces, cosmetic covers.
- **No:** Rod channels, bolt holes, bearing seats, any surface that mates with hardware.

Most slicers let you enable fuzzy skin per-model or paint it onto specific surfaces. Apply it only to the "show" faces.

#### Slicer Settings

**PrusaSlicer / OrcaSlicer:** Print Settings → Others → Fuzzy Skin → Type: "Outside Walls"

**Cura:** Search "Fuzzy Skin" in settings → Enable → Fuzzy Skin Outside Only

## MDF Base

Paint the MDF base **matte black** before assembly:

1. Sand the MDF lightly (220 grit).
2. Apply a coat of PVA wood sealer (prevents MDF from absorbing too much paint).
3. Apply 2 coats of matte black spray paint or roller paint.
4. Allow to dry fully before mounting hardware.

The black base visually recedes, making the grey structural parts the focal point. It also seals the MDF against moisture.

## Filament Recommendations

Any brand works. These are common, cheap options:

| Color | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| **Dark Grey** | eSun PLA+ Dark Grey, Hatchbox Dark Grey, Polymaker PolyLite Grey |
| **White** | Any white PLA/PLA+ (you only need a small amount for logo swaps) |

PLA+ is recommended for structural parts (better layer adhesion and impact resistance than standard PLA). PETG is also fine if you prefer it.
