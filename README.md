# Amalgam

### A 2026 RepRap Reference Specification

**High-Mass, Low-Cost, Total Control.**

---

## The Tractor is Coming

Amalgam is a scavenger-friendly 3D printer — a high-mass, fully parametric machine built from two donor printers and open-source intelligence. The name reflects its nature: an amalgam of salvaged parts merged into something new.

**Expected Release:** Q2/Q3 2026

---

## The Philosophy

We build a **"Tractor with the Brain of a Racecar"** — using heavy, high-torque, battle-tested hardware and giving it extreme precision through Klipper.

| Feature | Target |
|---------|--------|
| **Price** | < $300 AUD |
| **Build Volume** | 220×220×220mm |
| **Accuracy** | ±0.1mm |
| **Speed** | 70–120mm/s |
| **Control** | 100% Local, No Cloud |

## Quick Start

> **Before you build:** Read [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md). You're building a machine from salvaged parts that involves mains power, hot surfaces, and moving parts.

### Option 1: Configuration Wizard (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amalgam-3d/amalgam.git  # URL pending rename
cd amalgam

# Run the wizard - it asks what donor printers you have
python scripts/wizard.py
```

The wizard:
1. Asks what donor printers you have
2. Recommends a frame path (Scaffold, Mill, or Lathe)
3. Generates `config.py` for your specific build
4. Runs engineering analysis

### Option 2: Quick Analysis

```bash
# See what the reference spec looks like
python scripts/analyze.py --quick

# Explore trade-offs (what if M8 rods? what if 200x200 bed?)
python scripts/whatif.py --compare-rods
python scripts/whatif.py --compare-beds
```

### Option 3: Build STL Parts

```bash
cd cad
./setup.sh        # First time: creates venv, installs deps, configures
./build.sh build_all   # Build all STL files
```

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for complete guide.

## Frame Paths

Amalgam requires **two donor printers**. The frame path depends on what you scavenge:

| Path | Frame | Motion | Best Donors | Character |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Scaffold** | M10 Threaded Rod + MDF | Smooth Rods | Anet A8, Wanhao, Prusa i3 clones | Heritage — RepRap Darwin tribute |
| **Mill** | Aluminum Extrusion + MDF | V-Slots | Ender 3, CR-10, Voxelab Aquila | Zero-waste — use everything |
| **Lathe** | Aluminum Extrusion + MDF | Smooth Rods + IGUS | Ender 3 + bought rods, mixed | Precision — best motion quality |

**Cost:** ~$160-280 depending on path (Mill cheapest, Lathe ~$75 more for better motion).

**All paths share:** MDF base (squaring jig + damping), Triple-Z leveling, Pitan extruder, E3D V6, Klipper.

**Optional:** Add MKS SKIPR (~$130) for cleaner single-board electronics.

**Got one donor?** Just add Klipper to it. Amalgam requires two matching donors for a complete build.

## The Lineage

We stand on the shoulders of giants:

* **[RepRap Darwin (2007)](https://reprap.org/wiki/Darwin):** Box-frame threaded-rod origin. Inspired our "Scaffold" frame path.
* **[RepRap Mendel (2009)](https://reprap.org/wiki/Mendel):** The "plough" X-carriage sled design.
* **[Prusa i3 Rework (2013)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:119616):** Greg's Wade geared extruder—ancestor of our Pitan.
* **[Voron Legacy](https://vorondesign.com/voron_legacy):** Dual 8mm rods with vertical stacking for X-Y gantry.
* **[Voron Trident](https://vorondesign.com/voron_trident):** Three-pillar Z-drop bed with Triple-Z leveling.
* **[The 100](https://github.com/MSzturc/the100) / [The Rook](https://github.com/Kanrog/Rook):** Klipper-first philosophy on DIY frames.
