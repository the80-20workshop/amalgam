# Neo-Darwin

### A 2026 RepRap Reference Specification

**High-Mass, Low-Cost, Total Control.**

---

## 🚜 The Tractor is Coming

Neo-Darwin is a reimagining of the 2007 RepRap Darwin — a high-mass, fully parametric 3D printer built from M12 threaded rod, salvaged components, and open-source intelligence.

**Expected Release:** Q2/Q3 2026

---

## The Philosophy

We build a **"Tractor with the Brain of a Racecar"** — using heavy, high-torque, battle-tested hardware and giving it extreme precision through Klipper.

| Feature | Target |
|---------|--------|
| **Price** | < $300 AUD |
| **Build Volume** | 250–300mm³ |
| **Accuracy** | ±0.1mm (Tier 3+) |
| **Speed** | 70–120mm/s |
| **Control** | 100% Local, No Cloud |

## The Lineage

* **[RepRap Darwin (2007)](https://reprap.org/wiki/Darwin):** The origin. We carry its name forward.
* **[Prusa i3 Rework (2013)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:119616):** The source of our geared extruder heritage.
* **[RepRap Mendel Revisited (2024)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6783269):** A modern nod to the M12 skeleton.
* **[The 100](https://github.com/MSzturc/the100) / [The Rook](https://github.com/Kanrog/Rook) (2023):** Proof that Klipper makes DIY frames competitive.
